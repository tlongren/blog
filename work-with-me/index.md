## Freelance web developer, designer and general full-stack developer

  4. Other custom tools, various widgets and features for non-WordPress sites: ~$1500

### Managed WordPress Hosting: $70/month

  1. 1 WordPress site (fully managed)
  2. Full, nightly backups
  3. Unlimited visits/month
  4. Unlimited bandwidth
  5. Unlimited storage

If you need more, [get in touch][1] and we can work something out. I can accommodate nearly any need. From simply adding more sites, to a full blog network using [WordPress Multisite][2].

### About Me

I love [open source][3], and try to employ it whenever it makes sense, which it often does. Many take and take from the open source community, but I actively give back by open sourcing WordPress plugins, WordPress themes, and even jQuery plugins. I also contribute to many different projects on [GitHub][4].

Anyway, I&#8217;m available for freelance work and would [love to chat with you][1] about your project. I always provide a small example of previous code to so you know that I can accomplish what you need, and that I&#8217;m serious about meeting your needs.

I&#8217;m a one man shop, delivering the desired result on schedule (often before), and I charge a reasonable rate. Also, I&#8217;m open to flat-rate projects, if the circumstances are right.

I&#8217;ve been using PHP and MySQL for almost 15 years, starting when I was a sophomore in high school. From there, it was just kind of natural to learn CSS and HTML, and then eventually move on to CSS3 and HTML5. It&#8217;s sort of just been a normal progression I guess, sticking with PHP as my core backend language. I&#8217;d very much like to learn Python when I find the time. jQuery is my JavaScript library of choice, for now.

Over the years, I&#8217;ve built all sorts of websites, including static and dynamic business websites, blogs, e-commerce sites, custom business tools, and [API&#8217;s][5] for providing mobile apps access to website data.

[Have something in mind?][1]

## What I Do & How Well I Do It

PHP MySQL jQuery WordPress HTML5 CSS3 SVN Git JavaScript 

## WordPress

I like WordPress. I&#8217;m a published author, with [one book on WordPress under my belt][2]. It&#8217;s titled [WordPress Multisite Administration][2].

I&#8217;ve been actively developing themes and plugins for WordPress for at least the last 8 years, almost definitely longer. Most themes are custom and done for private parties, but one custom theme I&#8217;ve released is [Rootdip][6], better known as [HTML5Press][6].

### WordPress Functionality Plugin Creation

Heard about [functionality plugins][7], but don&#8217;t want to tackle creating one by yourself? [I can take care of it for you][1]! It&#8217;ll be light on your pocketbook, too, as I&#8217;ve done this a _few_ times. To learn more, read my post, [Creating A WordPress Functionality Plugin][7].
