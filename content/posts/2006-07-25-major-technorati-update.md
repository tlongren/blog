[Technorati just released][1] a new interface to the site. They haven&#8217;t just made changes to the appearance of the site however.

> First, in addition to a simpler and brighter design, we&#8217;ve continued to improve our core search technologies that index new information within minutes of being posted to the Web. We listened hard to your feedback &#8211; and redesigned the search results pages to include much less intrusive (and well-marked) ads, more results above the fold, and better sorting options &#8211; including sorting by language, authority, and freshness. If you&#8217;re confused, you can get a deeper explanation of keyword results and of URL results. In addition, our link-counting mechanisms have also been dramatically improved. If you&#8217;re a blogger, you should notice that your blog is being counted much more regularly, and that your rankings and authority information is much more accurate and up-to-date.

More regular counting of inbound links is awesome! Ranking and authority updates are nice too, I never put too much weight in those numbers as they never changed very often (maybe that&#8217;s good?). They&#8217;re also trying to make it easier to discover new content, via their [Discover section][2].

These upgrades look really great overall. They just [underwent a redesign][3] not too long ago (back in June of 2005). Wonder what we can expect next year?

[Mashable has screenshots][4] of the old Technorati versus the new Technorati.
