## VPN using a cheap VPS and sshuttle

It really is awesome, [sshuttle][1] basically allows you to browse the web via your VPS, in my case, a [VPS from DigitalOcean][2] (sponsored link, as are the others to DigtialOcean). It works on Linux and MacOS.

The GitHub repo explains it better than I can.

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <p>
    Transparent proxy server that works as a poor man&#8217;s VPN. Forwards over ssh. Doesn&#8217;t require admin. Works with Linux and MacOS. Supports DNS tunneling.
  </p>
</blockquote>

It hasn&#8217;t been updated in two years, but, no need to fix or change something that doesn&#8217;t need fixing or changing.

### So, Why? What&#8217;s the point?

I [run some Tor relays][3], one [out of my house][4], thanks Mediacom! `;)`

Because of this, many websites block me. **Kohl&#8217;s**, **Best Buy**, no posting on 4Chan (understandable), even **healthcare.gov** is blocked. I don&#8217;t want to pay for one of the many VPN services. Here&#8217;s the message I get at healthcare.gov without sshuttle.

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <p>
    Access Denied
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You don&#8217;t have permission to access &#8220;http://www.healthcare.gov/&#8221; on this server.<br /> Reference #18.22ea4d17.1397361569.6bb6afe
  </p>
</blockquote>

VPN&#8217;s even provide vital Internet access to [those facing government censorship][5], and worse.

### Options

Setting up a secure VPN server on a linux box can be a pain, and definitely takes longer than 5 minutes. [sshuttle][1] takes about that, maybe, if you type really slow.

So, for me, when I found [sshuttle][1], my heart was set, the other options didn&#8217;t matter.

### Setting Up sshuttle On Ubuntu Flavors

Doesn&#8217;t get any easier than this. Run the following in a terminal:

<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">sudo apt-get install sshuttle</pre>

Now, we&#8217;re basically going to SSH to our VPS/server. Again, run this in the terminal:

<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">sshuttle -r username@vps.yourdomain.com 0/0 -vv</pre>

After running `sshuttle -r username@vps.yourdomain.com 0/0 -vv` you&#8217;ll be asked for the root password. And sometimes, for whatever reason, it dies immediately after running the `sshuttle` command.

**If sshuttle doesn&#8217;t work** after running it the first time, **run it again**! It should work the second time. It could be something with the system I&#8217;m on, so hopefully this is isolated to me. `:)`

### Setting Up sshuttle On MacOS

When someone donates me a new Macbook Pro 15&#8243;, I&#8217;ll start writing this stuff. `:)`  
**Update: April 21, 2014** [Have a look at this post for using sshuttle with MacOS][6]. Comes courtesy of [Aaron Bull Schaefer in the comments][7].

### And if I need a VPS?

You can find a [cheap VPS][2] easily with Google. [DigitalOcean has them for $5/month][2], which will be plenty sufficient to use specifically for [sshuttle][1].

[ChunkHost is another][8] good option for a cheap VPS.

### Other Options

Lots of other options have [been mentioned in the thread at Hacker News][9]. Check em out. Some really good suggestions that are sometimes even cheaper!
