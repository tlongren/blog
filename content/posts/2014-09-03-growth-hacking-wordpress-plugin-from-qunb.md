I&#8217;ve been using [qunb][1] for quite a while. They generate what they call **datastories** for your sites using Google Analytics data. The datastories include data like number of visitors, top countries, and most viewed pages. They do a really nice job of presenting your analytics data in a more human readable fashion, a good birds-eye view of it all.

I got an email from qunb announcing the release of their WordPress plugin, <Growth Hacking Analytics by qunb.com>. It&#8217;s available in the [WordPress plugin directory][2].

After installing the plugin, you&#8217;ll need to authorize it to use your Google Analytics account. You can also connect your Facebook page and Twitter account, but those don&#8217;t require any special permissions.

[Qunb has also setup a Google Group][3] that will host discussions about bugs and ideas for improvements. As of this post, however, the Google Group gives me a page titled &#8220;_Authorization Failed_&#8220;, with a message stating &#8220;_Please sign in with an authorized account to view this content_&#8220;.

The WordPress plugin will add a new sub-menu to the main Dashboard menu. It has 4 main parts to it. The first shows stats about visitors or pageviews, you can select which you want to view. The second part shows pageview stats on the most recent post. The third part, titled _Tops of the day_, lists your top posts, best social network in terms of referrals, and the best non-social referrer. The fourth and last part displays the growth comparison compared to the last week. You can also view growth comparison for the last month, but you&#8217;ll need to have a paid qunb account for that.

The starter plan is $5/month and includes unlimited datastories, and there&#8217;s no limit on the number of websites you track. 

<div class="wpulike wpulike-default " >
  <div class="wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked">
