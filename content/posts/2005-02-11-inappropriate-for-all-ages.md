[Lokitorrent.com][1] has officially been shutdown. After a couple months of asking for donations from users to fight MPAA lawsuits, the site has been shutdown.

The message from the MPAA on Lokitorrent is pretty funny. &#8220;Illegal Downloading: Inappropriate for All Ages&#8221;. And, &#8220;You Can Click, But You Can&#8217;t Hide&#8221;. People using these sites need to start being more &#8220;anonymous&#8221;. These organizations, MPAA and RIAA, need to learn doing things like this isn&#8217;t going to help their cause. People will always steal your products. You might as well get used to it, cuz it&#8217;s not gonna stop. When all the bittorrent sites get shutdown, some other P2P technology will come out.

I expect the next big P2P app will employ the use of some sort of anonymizing technology to prevent &#8220;paper&#8221; trails leading back to downloaders. A redesigned bittorrent would be ideal for implementing something like this because BitTorrent isn&#8217;t run off a &#8220;central server&#8221;.

Anyway, you should check out [lokitorrent.com][1] just for the amusing messages.
