[Iraqis are voting][1] in what some say is the most important election yet. The Sunnis, who boycotted the parliamentary election in January &#8217;04, are expected to turn out in droves for this election. 1000 or so Sunni clerics [issued _fatwas_][2] urging their followers to participate in this election.

> More than 1,000 Sunni clerics issued a religious decree, or fatwa , urging their followers to vote, rallying what is expected to be a massive turnout by Sunnis, who widely obeyed the clerics&#8217; instructions to boycott parliamentary elections in January.

[Bill Roggio][3] is on the ground in Iraq, go check it out for some election coverage right from the source. There&#8217;s lots of purple finger photos floating in the blogosphere right now. Iraqis have an impressive amount of support coming from U.S. bloggers and bloggers throughout the world. The large list of bloggers below wishing Iraqis the best is a prime example. I can&#8217;t believe we&#8217;ve made this much progress in such short time. Other bloggers:  
[Iraq the Model][4]  
[Stop the ACLU][5]  
[No End But Victory][6]  
[American Future][7]  
[Ankle Biting Pundits][8]  
[The Indepundit][9]  
[American Warmonger][10]  
[Michelle Malkin][11]  
[Outside The Beltway][12]  
[In The Bullpen][13]  
[Conservative Thinking][14]

**UPDATE:** Brian at [Iowa Voice][15] has an update noting the apparently spetacular success of the Iraqi elections. It&#8217;s estimated that up to 15 million Iraqis voted! [The CIA World Factbook][16] estimates the population of Iraq to be about 26 million. That number coming from back in July 2005, so it&#8217;s pretty recent. That&#8217;s 57% voter turnout, but all of those 26 million aren&#8217;t registered voters, so, I dunno. Really, there can&#8217;t be much more than 20 million Iraqis of the age to vote. That puts the voter turnout close to 75%, I&#8217;d say that&#8217;s a pretty impressive show.
