[SlimStat][1] is a nice little PHP software package designed to help you track visits to your website or blog. [Download Squad][2] had a post about SlimStat this morning that sparked my interest.

> I&#8217;ve been using Shaun Inman&#8217;s great ShortStat for a while. However, I wanted to be able to drill down into the stats and look at things in more detail.
> 
> When I started editing the code, I kept thinking of more and more things I&#8217;d like to change. SlimStat is the result.

<!--adsense-->

  
SlimStat is based on ShortStat. ShortStat is no longer being developed. Instead the original author of ShortStat (Shaun Inman), is now working on [Mint][3], which I&#8217;ve been using for the last few months. But none of that has anything to do with SlimStat. SlimStat has a different developer (Stephen Wettone). He just picked up where Shaun left off basically.

[Blogging Pro][4] also has a post about SlimStat, and a related WordPress plugin, [WP-SlimStat][5]. Although, the WordPress plugin uses SlimStat 0.9.2 where the current release of SlimStat is 0.9.4.
