I really dig this Flat Shadow jQuery plugin. You can find a [demo here][1]. It can be [found on GitHub, too][2].

Saw [this on DesignerNews][3] earlier today and knew I&#8217;d have a use for it. Will probably use it to replace the [image on the Work With Me page][4].

The plugin was originally released in August of 2013. It hasn&#8217;t seen much for updates, the [most recent][5] was in January 2014 and was a simple change to the README to include a license.

[Searched on codepen.io][6] quick to see if I could find anything using this plugin. One pen, [Long Shadow Icon Prototype][7], looks to be using the plugin. It was created about the same time that the plugin was pushed to GitHub.

I haven&#8217;t used this yet, but the demo is super simple and looks really easy to use. Looking forward to playing around with it.

Detailed usage instructions and other customization options [can be found on GitHub][2]. 

<div class="wpulike wpulike-default " >
  <div class="wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked">
    <button type="button"
					aria-label="Like Button"
					data-ulike-id="6188"
					data-ulike-nonce="1754074c37"
					data-ulike-type="likeThis"
					data-ulike-template="wpulike-default"
					data-ulike-display-likers="0"
