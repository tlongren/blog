About one month till the elections in Iraq. That&#8217;s not very long considering the people don&#8217;t even know the names of the candidates.

Candidate names are being withheld for security reasons. This is a joke. How can a person make an informed decision at the polls when they don&#8217;t have much time to get to know the candidates? A month left and the candidates names haven&#8217;t been released. Democracy can&#8217;t take root under these circumstances.

Going ahead with the elections is a big mistake. Militias in Iraq have been threatening &#8220;[don&#8217;t vote ~ or else!][1]&#8220;. The fact that the Iraqi people don&#8217;t even know who they&#8217;re gonna be voting for is just silly. The U.S. will end up appointing a president anyway. It&#8217;s not like the votes count.

At least the Iraqi people don&#8217;t have to deal with T.V. campaign ads for 2 years prior to the election. The whole situation is shit.
