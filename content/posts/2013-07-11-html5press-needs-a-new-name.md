Help! HTML5Press needs a new name. As you may know, I&#8217;ve been [trying to get it accepted][1] into the [official WordPress Theme directory][2]. I ran the theme checker plugin a lot and fixed all of the issues it found, which were very minimal. It even works nicely with the [The Unit Test][3]. However, the name is more of an issue.

Here&#8217;s what the reviewer, ZGni, had to [say on the ticket][4]:

> I don&#8217;d believe that HTML5Press is acceptable as a theme name &#8211; Reference: â€‹http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme\_Review#Theme\_Name for more details.  
> Due to the above Naming Requirement I&#8217;m resolving this ticket as not Approved.  
> Please see the link above and re-upload the new version with a new name &#8211; when done leave a comment here and I&#8217;ll pick up the ticket to continue with the review. I also strongly advise you test your theme and check that it meets all requirements before re-submitting it.

Basically, it&#8217;s because &#8220;Themes are not to use version-specific, markup-related terms&#8221;, like HTML5, as stated in the [theme naming guidelines][5] (Under the _Theme Name_ heading). So, time for something different.

It&#8217;s time to get a new name for HTML5Press before I can re-submit to the theme directory. So, anyone got any suggestions?

I&#8217;ve come up with 5 [really random ones][6] you can vote on. However, if someone suggests a name that I really like, I may just use it. If nobody suggests one that I really like, the one with highest votes will be the new name. The poll will remain open for 2 weeks, ending 12:01 AM July 26.

</div>

**Update:** I voted for _RootDip_. I really don&#8217;t want WareChop, so I will be very sad if it wins. This was a horrible idea.

**Update 2:** [_RootDip_ it is][7].
