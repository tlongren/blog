Chief Justice William Rehnquist [died lastnight][1] at his home in Virginia. He was [80 years old][2].

Lots of people think it&#8217;s gonna get really ugly for Bush in the coming weeks. I&#8217;ve got no doubt it&#8217;ll get ugly. He&#8217;s got Katrina, Iraq, and two Supreme Court positions to fill.

Jay over at [Stop The ACLU][3] expects to see a whole new level of looniness from the democrats. [Rossputin][4] asks some really good questions and tries to offer a little insight as to what we might expect:

> The political implications of this situation, having two Supreme Court vacancies simultaneously, will whip radicals (environmental, racial, sexual, economic) and collectivists of all sorts into a frenzy of paranoia which will make the Roberts process so far look positively tame. It might even make what happened to Robert Bork look civilized.

[SactoDan][5] thinks the Democrats are already stretched thin and may have trouble coming up with a &#8220;combat&#8221; stragety. He&#8217;s probably right, the dems have gotta be freakin.

It amazes me that Rehnquist hadn&#8217;t retired. The man deserves our deepest respect as a country, no two ways about that.

Others covering include [Wizbang][6], [Scared Monkeys][7], [The Moderate Voice][8], [Michelle Malkin][9] and [Hyscience][10].

And yah, I fucked this post up. Somehow it came out with 3 different post ID&#8217;s. Some trackbacks point to the post ID&#8217;s that don&#8217;t exist any longer.
