## Now on GitHub {.subtitle}

Took a bit longer than I wanted, but the source for [passwds.io][1] is up [on GitHub now][2].

It&#8217;s extremely simple, using [Twitter Bootstrap][3], straight [PHP][4], [jQuery][5], and the [jQuery prettySocial plugin][6] for the social buttons at the bottom of the site.

Passwords are generated using [pwgen-php from Superwayne][7]. pwgen-php was [forked a couple years ago][8] by [Roderik van der Veer][9], which I was unaware of.

I&#8217;ll be updating to the somewhat newer [pwgen-php library from Roderik][8] at some point.

Basically, an [AJAX request is sent][10] to a [PHP file][11], grabbing the requested passwords, and then the results are displayed.

Pretty simple. Let me know if you have suggestions or questions. Please be kind, I threw this together in [about an hour one evening][12].
