I&#8217;ve added 20 [Google Web Fonts][1] to HTML5Press. I pretty much just chose 20 fonts at random and went with them. The default font is still Droid Serif. You can choose one of these fonts via the theme options page.  
[ad]  
The first 20 fonts are:

> Antic  
> Volkhov  
> Numans  
> Voltaire  
> Short Stack  
> Questrial  
> Comfortaa  
> Rationale  
> Varela Round  
> Abel  
> Gloria Hallelujah  
> Sue Ellen Francisco  
> Nothing You Could Do  
> Amaranth  
> Quattrocento Sans  
> IM Fell Great Primer SC  
> PT Sans Narrow  
> Walter Turncoat  
> Jura  
> Coming Soon 

You can see [previews of those fonts here][2].

</div>

If you vote &#8220;yes&#8221; and have a specific font in mind, please leave a comment here and let me know what font you&#8217;d like included. I&#8217;d be happy to include any fonts requested.

Oh, and if you&#8217;re curious, I&#8217;m using the &#8220;Gloria Hallelujah&#8221; font as of this posting.

**UPDATE 9/7/2011:** I [added][3] [25 more fonts][4]. All ~50 fonts will be available when HTML5Press 2.0 is released. If you&#8217;d like to try it early, you can [download it from Github][5].
