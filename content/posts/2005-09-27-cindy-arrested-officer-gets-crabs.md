Cindy Sheehan [got herself arrested][1] in front of the white house yesterday. It&#8217;s pretty obvious that she was trying to get arrested. Nobody would be paying attention to her today/yesterday had she not gotten arrested.

Chris Short [has the pictures][2] of her being carried away. Not sure why that one cop has his hand up her little denim skirt thingy. I&#8217;d cut my fuckin hand off after that, I wouldn&#8217;t want to leave any chance for the crabs to spread to my brain.

I can&#8217;t believe that average people actually feel sorry for her still. I just don&#8217;t believe it. I&#8217;d hope that most americans are better judges of character than that, I could be wrong though. She&#8217;s just continuing her media-whore onslaught. She&#8217;s probably totally forgotten about her son and her mother that had a stroke. All she does is bitch and suck up valuable air that I had dibs on months ago. How dare she.

While we&#8217;re on the media-whore subject, [the Anchoress][3] has a post detailing media whores and their creators.

Other people writing about Cindy getting arrested include [Blogs for Bush][4], [Let&#8217;s Blame Bush][5] and [Daily Pundit][6]. The Political Teen has [a poll][7] and [a video][8].

Linking the [Mudville Gazette open post][9].

**UPDATE:** Thanks for the amusing e-mails. And you guys call me sick&#8230;
