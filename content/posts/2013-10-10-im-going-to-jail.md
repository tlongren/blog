I missed a court date while my wife was in the hospital. No excuse, I realize. Honestly, it just slipped my mind, and I take responsibility for that.

Got a letter in the mail today stating there&#8217;s a bench warrant for my arrest. I&#8217;ll be going in on Sunday afternoon to turn myself in. I just hope the judge actually looks at the circumstances instead of just blindly ruling, as is typical.

I was lucky enough to be granted a third pre-trial meeting, which the judge was reluctant to give me. However, it was this meeting that I missed. At this meeting, I was going to agree to plead guilty as to avoid the expenses related to trial. My wife had been in the hospital for a seizure that left her with [sudden onset neurogenic stuttering][1], a really crazy thing to have happen, it sounds like.

I&#8217;ll have a follow up post in a few days with more details, and what&#8217;s going to happen from here on. I expect probation for about 6 months, maybe community service, I dunno. That is, provided I&#8217;m not in waaay more trouble for missing the pre-trial conference.

One thing is for sure though, I&#8217;ll almost undoubtedly have to spend a day or two in jail due to missing the court date. I hope I can prove I&#8217;m not a flight risk and don&#8217;t need to be held. I mean, I have a [LOT of][2] [other things][3] going on. Leaving is the last thing on my mind, lol. Not to mention the 9 to 5 gig that I fucking love!!!

**Update October 19, 2013:** Will post more after court is finished, which will be early November. Looking good though. ðŸ™‚

**Update October 11, 2013:** I&#8217;ll have more to post on Monday, October 14, or possibly Tuesday, October 15. I have trial October 14 and it&#8217;s hard saying what&#8217;ll happen. I have since retained legal counsel, and he&#8217;s already gotten the prosecuting attorney to recommend a deferred judgement to the judge. My attorney is also going to be requesting a new judge, because the current judge does not like me at all. A couple court appearances ago, he didn&#8217;t believe that I was &#8220;Tyler Longren&#8221;, instead he was insisting that I was his legal counsel. I believe he thought that because I had a suit on. Judgmental mother fucker.

I&#8217;ll also be elaborating on why I even had to go to court in the first place in the coming days. However, the photo attached to this post should give you a pretty good idea of why I&#8217;m in this situation. ðŸ™‚
