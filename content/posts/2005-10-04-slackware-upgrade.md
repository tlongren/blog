[Dropline Gnome 2.12.0][1] was released yesterday. It&#8217;s been maybe about a month since Gnome 2.12.0 was released. I&#8217;d say the Dropline team did a pretty damn good job getting 2.12.0 out the door so quickly. I can&#8217;t believe how many packages they have to maintain.

Dropline Gnome 2.12.0 was built for [Slackware 10.2][2]. Slackware 10.2 hasn&#8217;t been out too long yet. Being that DLG 2.12.0 recommends slackware 10.2, I upgraded my system lastnight from Slackware 10.1 to 10.2.

Everything went pretty much as I had planned. I spent about 2 hours backing stuff up and making sure I had everything I could possibly need. The only thing I forgot to grab was the &#8220;./configure&#8221; strings I use to build PHP. Fortunately, I use basically the same method for the servers at work. I had been planning on upgrading to Slack 10.2 days after it was released. I had been putting it off far too long. I&#8217;m glad DLG 2.12.0 was released, or I still wouldn&#8217;t be running slackware 10.2.
