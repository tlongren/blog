The Des Moines Register is reporting that [Sinclair and Mediacom have reached an agreement][1]. Apparently they came to this agreement late lastnight (friday night). I was flipping around channels lastnight and noticed Fox News at 9 was on KDSM Fox 17.

KGAN, the CBS affiliate in Cedar Rapids, is also back on the air, just in time for the Super Bowl. All this comes on the heels of Mediacoms [announcement of a price increase][2]. KCCI (Des Moines CBS affiliate) also [has some news][3] on the Mediacom/Sinclair deal:

> Stations, including Fox affiliate KDSM and CBS affiliate KGAN, will be immediately restored in 12 states, according to a Mediacom news release.

I&#8217;m very happy Mediacom and Sinclair have reached an agreement, even though I&#8217;ve got the feeling Mediacom caved to Sinclair&#8217;s demands. I just want to be able to watch Simpsons and King of the Hill again after I get off work. ðŸ™‚
