This is pretty interesting. A blend between [Technorati][1] and [Google][2] by way of [sinceretheory][3]:

> Someone put together a handy utitlity called GMacker.com. Its purpose its simple. Google more like Technorarti. You can query Google within certain timeframes. This page allows you two query fields of which you can start your navigating.
> 
> The top form is a simple text box with a ‚Äúdays back field‚Äù next to it. That means that whatever you search for will look for new results on Google within the amount of days you have assigned. The second query field is pretty much the same idea but this time you can input your search terms and assign a range of dates for Google to look for.

I think they should adopt &#8220;Googorati&#8221; as the official tool name. [Try it out here.][4]
