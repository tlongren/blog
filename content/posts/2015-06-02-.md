[Papertrail][1] (referral link) is awesome and made it almost too easy to find the culprit. I love [Papertrail][2] and have [posted][3] [about][4] [it][5] [in][6] the past a few times.

You can see all my posts about [Papertrail in the tag archive][7]. Papertrail made it so easy due to the fact that longren.io apache logs get sent to Papertrail, and their search is so useful.
