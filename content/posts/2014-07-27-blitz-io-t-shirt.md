## It pays (in t-shirts) to be an early adopter {.subtitle}

Got me a t-shirt from the fine folks at [Blitz.io][1]. It&#8217;s the only service that I use for load testing and generally bringing my sites to their knees. It&#8217;s cheap and highly configurable. I suggest you at least [give them a try][1].

They recently offered t-shirts to early adopters, I was apparently one. Here&#8217;s part of the e-mail I received from [Blitz.io][1]:

> The Blitz team wants to thank you for being an early adopter of our services. On July 1, 2014, we will be increasing our pricing and although prices for others will be changing, your subscription plan rates will remain unchanged.
> 
> Your support is a big reason for our success and as a token of our gratitude, we would like to offer you a complimentary Blitz gift. Please reach out to us at the support email below, let us know your t-shirt size, and we&#8217;ll do the rest. 

If you didn&#8217;t get the email, you&#8217;re out of luck. If you are a [Blitz.io][1] user and did get the email, **follow the directions at the bottom of the email to get your free t-shirt!**

For those who don&#8217;t know, Blitz.io provides load testing _from the cloud_. Here&#8217;s a bit about how [Blitz.io][1] works.

> Blitz has been created to help application and website developers manage and test performance throughout the development lifecycle. Through development, staging, production and operations, it is critical to ensure that your application meets the highest levels of user satisfaction.
> 
> Use Blitz credits to perform cloud based load tests at every step of development to help dramatically improve the quality of your applications and websites. We offer powerful capabilities including continuous monitoring, performance testing, and remediation.

If you&#8217;re building a website or web app that you expect to receive a decent volume of traffic, it&#8217;s a good idea to put it through it&#8217;s paces using [Blitz.io][1] first. Your app not scaling after launch would probably be a bit of an issue. `:)`
