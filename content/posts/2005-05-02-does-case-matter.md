Does the case of a URL matter when building links to your site? Saw this on [Search Engine Roundtable][1] this morning:

> Moderator Egol pointed me to an excellent SEO Chat thread named [URL Casing][2]. The question is, if I had a domain name such as www.bigbluepineapplechair.com and you wanted to tell people to go to www.BigBluePineappleChair.com to make it easier to read, then would that affect your link building campaign?

A forum member posted a follow-up with some good insight, so [read the rest of the story][1]. 

<div class="wpulike wpulike-default " >
  <div class="wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked">
    <button type="button"
					aria-label="Like Button"
					data-ulike-id="1841"
					data-ulike-nonce="d9aa47f192"
					data-ulike-type="likeThis"
					data-ulike-template="wpulike-default"
					data-ulike-display-likers="0"
					data-ulike-disable-pophover="0"
					class="wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_likethis_1841"></button><span class="count-box"></span>
  </div>
