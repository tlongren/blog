I guess that title doesn&#8217;t make any sense. Or maybe it makes more sense than it does at first glance, Cindy is silly and she&#8217;s basically a sheep that follows everyone. Nevermind the thousands of sheep she has following her. She&#8217;s half sheep, half shepard. There.

Anyway, back to the fences. Cindy Sheehan is gearing up to tie herself to a fence at the White House. When will she be doing this you ask? [Once 2000 american soldiers][1] have lost their lives in Iraq. Seems almost like a celebration rather than a protest or whatever the hell tying yourself to a fence could be classified as.

&#8220;Hey everybody! Look at me, I&#8217;m tied to a fence! Pay attention to me! yay!&#8221; See, I can tell the future, that&#8217;s what she&#8217;ll be screaming once she&#8217;s actually tied. This is straight from the sheeps mouth though, seriously:

> &#8220;I&#8217;m going to go to Washington, D.C. and I&#8217;m going to give a speech at the White House, and after I do, I&#8217;m going to tie myself to the fence and refuse to leave until they agree to bring our troops home,&#8221; Sheehan said in a telephone interview last week as the milestone approached.

Good luck crackhead. Like the United States will risk millions of lives here @ home just to save yours. I hope Cindy Sheehan is allowed to expire on the lawn of the White House. I mean no disrespect to her family or anything, just her. Let&#8217;s face it, she&#8217;s fighting for the rights and freedoms of those trying to kill us. Without troops in Iraq and elsewhere, we here at home would be target numero uno.

Cindy, please, please for the love of god stop your anti-U.S. propoganda slinging and take a good hard look at who we&#8217;re fighting in this war on terror. It&#8217;s not the &#8220;war on WMD&#8221;, it&#8217;s the &#8220;war on terror&#8221;. Shut up about there being no WMD&#8217;s in Iraq, because that&#8217;s a flat out lie. Just because the ingredients aren&#8217;t put together yet doesn&#8217;t mean they weren&#8217;t intending to make the full batch. I mean shit, I can&#8217;t even buy two fucking boxes of sudafed because I could make meth with it. And had I bought two+ boxes a year ago I&#8217;d end up on some sort of blacklist which would end up getting my house put under surveillance.

It&#8217;s so sweet how you don&#8217;t whine and complain about my right to buy two boxes of sudafed being taken away, yet you&#8217;ll fight endlessly to let the terrorists roam freely in countries un-willing to stand up to them.

I&#8217;ll be the first guy to point out problems in my country. Anyone ever take a gander through the archives (although the links aren&#8217;t there, the archives still are)? I was convinced we would be living in a 100% police-state environment within 20 years, not so much the case now. Why? Because I realized this country won&#8217;t even be here in 20 years unless we make an effort right now to stop those who want to kill us just because we&#8217;re not muslim and because we don&#8217;t acknowledge Mohammed. Oh, and Mohammed can suck a nut. If ya see him floatin around there in &#8220;the aural world&#8221; Cindy, tell him I say what up and he can stop by anytime he needs more nut in his mouth&#8230;I&#8217;m always willing to lend a helping testicle.

OK, so that&#8217;s enough tearing people (and deities) to shreds. Other blogs reporting on the subject (althought not nearly as vulgur) include [California Conservative][2] and [Blogs for Bush][3]. California Conservative had a link to Ace&#8217;s [post about crotchless panties][4]. Oddly enough, this does relate to the subject at hand. I think [Ace][4] has every reason to be worried, I know I don&#8217;t wanna have to gouge my eyes out anytime soon. And, they do make crotchless panties for sheep, correct? I swear to god there was a pair on _Insomniac_ (Dave Attell&#8217;s old show). I&#8217;ll keep that in mind as a Christmas present for lady Sheehan.
