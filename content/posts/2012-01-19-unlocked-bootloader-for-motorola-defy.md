No, the Motorola Defy bootloader hasn&#8217;t been unlocked (yet). Rumor has it that a few individuals do have Defy&#8217;s with unlocked bootloaders though. Why is having an unlocked bootloader important you ask? Have a look at [this article from AddictiveTips][1] for a good summary of what a bootloader is, and why they are often locked.

The OP in a thread on XDA that I came across earlier today claimed to have found a method to unlock the Motorola Defy bootloader. The OP said he would be posting a video with proof of the bootloader unlock, which I don&#8217;t think ever came. I checked the thread again later and was disappointed to see that it had been removed from XDA. So, it was likely someone taking Defy owners for a ride, getting our hopes up without actually having a method to unlock.

This doesn&#8217;t mean it won&#8217;t happen. [Epsylon3][2] is believed to be working on this, and if anyone can do this, it&#8217;s him. He recently managed to brick his original Defy, but received enough donations so that he could buy a new one. So, it sounds like he will continue working on the bootloader unlock.

There&#8217;s two threads on XDA that you should follow if you&#8217;re interested in keeping up with the status of unlocking the Motorola Defy bootloader.

1. <http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1443678>

Or, you could subscribe here (on the right) to keep up to date. If anything new develops on the Defy bootloader unlock front, I&#8217;ll be sure to post.
