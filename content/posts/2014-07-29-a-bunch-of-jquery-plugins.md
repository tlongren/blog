## Plugins to ease development for front-end designers {.subtitle}

I saw [jQuery-Plugins repository][1] in my GitHub Today email yesterday. I&#8217;m a sucker for collections of cool things, and this repo is just that. It&#8217;s basically a collection of simple jQuery plugins that are very easy to use, requiring little or no experience with jQuery or JavaScript.

Here&#8217;s a little from the plugin&#8217;s README:

> These jQuery plugins have been created to ease the pain that some front-end designers feel when they&#8217;re trying to implement basic features with little or no JavaScript or jQuery experience.
> 
> I plan to add plugins to this repository over time that only require HTML code, data-* attributes, and the inclusion of the script in question, following the same kind of principles as the Twitter Bootstrap extensions, in so far that no coding experience should be required in order to make things work.

It looks like there&#8217;s 4 plugins included:

  1. Carousel
  2. ClassToggle
  3. Google Analytics Helper
  4. SnapSlider

The developer has plans to continue adding more simple plugins.

The examples can be seen individually, too. Here&#8217;s the [Carousel plugin in action][2]. Here&#8217;s [a few ClassToggle examples][3]. There&#8217;s also a [Google Analytics Helper example][4], showing how to track events and URL&#8217;s.

jQuery-Plugins looks like it could be a useful set of plugins. I may actually use the Carousel plugin for an upcoming project.

[These plugins][1] will come in handy for almost anyone, frontend or backend developers. [Check them out][1]!
