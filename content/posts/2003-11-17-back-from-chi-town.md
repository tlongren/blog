We&#8217;re back from moving the office to Chicago. The U-Haul was way overloaded. It ended up taking us about 7 hours to move everything off the truck into the office. We had a freight elevator to use but it was messed up and would wait about 30 seconds to open the door after reaching the destination floor.

I&#8217;m definately glad that moving is all over with. My entire body is sore&#8230;there was a LOT of very, very heavy stuff.
