**UPDATE:** Get [SK2-WP2Compatibility][1], a plugin for Spam Karma 2. It fixes the comment count problem mentioned below when using Spam Karma 2 with WordPress 2.0. OK, just wanted to get that out in the open. Please continue.

Now that I&#8217;ve spent a little more time with WordPress 2.0 RC1, I&#8217;ve discovered a plugin compatibility problem that&#8217;s probably going to [destroy me][2]. [Spam Karma 2][3] causes some problems when updating the &#8220;comment\_count&#8221; value in the &#8220;wp\_posts&#8221; table. It doesn&#8217;t just cause problems displaying comment numbers, I had to manually updated that field for some posts. But, it&#8217;s not like this type of thing wasn&#8217;t expected. I&#8217;m not brave enough to run slackware-current on my main workstation anymore, this works for me though.

So, I can either use Spam Karma and not have any comment counts for new or updated posts, or I can just stop using Spam Karma. I really don&#8217;t want to let Spam Karma go. I&#8217;ve already seen about 200 trackback/comment spams since disabling Spam Karma earlier today. I really hope to see a new release of [Spam Karma][3] that works with WordPress 2.0. I guess this problem [was known about][4] a few weeks ago. I somehow didn&#8217;t notice it when I upgraded to 2.0 beta 1 and then to 2.0 beta 2.

Anybody know of a comment/trackback spam WordPress plugin that&#8217;s known to work with 2.0? There&#8217;s the list in the support forums, which also happens to discuss the Spam Karma problems. I may see if the latest [WordPress Hashcash][5] will work at all.

There is good news though, not really relating to WordPress though. [FireFox 1.5][6] stable is out! You can get FireFox 1.5 at the [new official home][7] of FireFox and Thunderbird, [Mozilla.com][7].

Also, my [favorite Mint Pepper][8] has been updated to work with [Mint 1.23][9]. I was thinking of downgrading to Mint 1.14 just so I could have the Outclicks Pepper. [Andrew Sutherland][8] couldn&#8217;t have picked a better time to release his updated pepper.

**CONTINUED UPDATE:** Too bad I didn&#8217;t [see this][10] about an hour ago. Looks like I&#8217;ll get to keep my Spam Karma thanks to [SK2-WP2Compatibility][1], a plugin for Spam Karma 2.

> SK2-WP2Compatibility is a plugin for Spam Karma 2. It has no effect without Spam Karma 2.0 or higher being already installed on your WordPress system.  
> This plugin has no spam fighting or spam killing abilities. Instead, it is intended to provide a way by which all users moving to WordPress 2.0 can enjoy the benefits of Spam Karma &#8211; without having to worry about WordPress 2.0 specific changes.

Might not need that SK2 plugin for too long, there&#8217;s word of a [Spam Karma 2.1][1] soon.
