[California Conservative][1] has some really wicked looking photos of hurricane Katrina as it was making landfall. One of their readers submitted the photos. I&#8217;m not gonna post them here, just head over to [California Conservative][1] to check them out.

The second picture is 100% pure amazing. I can&#8217;t believe how high the cloud walls extend. Very, very good pictures. Check em out.  
**  
UPDATE:** [Peenie Wallie][2] brought to my attention these aren&#8217;t Katrina photos. Just various weather [phenomenon photos][3]. Still worth taking a look at.
