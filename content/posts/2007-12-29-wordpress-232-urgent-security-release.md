The [WordPress][1] folks have [released WordPress 2.3.2][2], describing it as an urgent security release. This latest version fixes [a bug][3] that can be exploited to display your draft posts. Some [changes][4] have also been made to prevent certain error messages from giving away more information about your database than they need to. I would strongly advise that WordPress users **install 2.3.2 ASAP**.  
<!--adsense-->

  
WordPress 2.3.2 includes a new feature to allow you to customize the error page that&#8217;s displayed when WordPress can&#8217;t connect to your database. You can see the [full list of changes][5] between 2.3.1 and 2.3.2, you can also see [which bugs are fixed][6] in WordPress 2.3.2.

Head over to [the 2.3.2 announcement post][2] on the [Dev Blog][7] for the full story on WordPress 2.3.2. If you don&#8217;t care about any of that, you can just head straight to [the download][8].
