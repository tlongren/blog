I had been using [personalized Google][1] for quite a while as my homepage. Mostly because I haven&#8217;t gotten a [Feedlounge][2] account yet. Anyway, I noticed some changes to personalized Google this morning. They added the ability to add many more news sources.

It&#8217;s now possible to store bookmarks with Google. You just add a few URL&#8217;s and their descriptions and they&#8217;ll be listed on your personalized Google homepage. RSS feeds can also be added now, which is awesome! It&#8217;s a pretty basic RSS feed reader but it works for me. It doesn&#8217;t show any detail on the RSS feed stories, but it does grab the titles and provides a link to the entire story.

I knew this feature was coming soon, just wasn&#8217;t sure when. I half expected to see this when I got back from Colorado, a couple days later works I guess. Diggity over @ They&#8217;re Just Words says personalized Google is [now his official homepage][3]. If I wasn&#8217;t using it as my homepage before, I definately would be now just because of the RSS features. Search Engine Hearld also [makes note][4] of the added features.

And of course, Search Engine Roundtable, has [all the info along with links][5] to forums discussing these newly added features to personalized Google. If you haven&#8217;t tried personalized Google out yet, I suggest you at least [give it a shot][1].
