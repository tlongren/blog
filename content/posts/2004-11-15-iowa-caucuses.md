There&#8217;s lots of talk going on about doing away with the Iowa caucuses. I think it&#8217;d probably be a good idea to do. It&#8217;s a fact that Iowa is mostly white, rural people. They&#8217;re making huge decisions that affect the rest of the country.

A state with a wider variety of ethnic groups would be better suited to have Iowa&#8217;s role. If the caucuses get taken away from us, we&#8217;ll just be like Montana and Idaho. I think we have a whopping 7 electoral votes (not sure).

This has been the subject of much debate over at [daily KOS][1]. A writer for the [Des Moines Register][2] even mentioned the discussions at daily KOS in a recent article of hers. Here&#8217;s one of the items at daily KOS:

It&#8217;s all very interesting. Especially to me because Iowa isn&#8217;t typically the center of any sort of politics.
