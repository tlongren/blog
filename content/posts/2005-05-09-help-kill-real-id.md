The Real ID Act is basically going to make it to U.S. citizens have to have a national ID card. Bill Sanchez, owner of the site [UnrealID][1], says this:

> We have less than 48 hours to stop our nation from having a National ID card scheme. Do we really want to have the same ID system as Communist China? I think not.
> 
> The US Senate is scheduled to vote this Tuesday on the Real ID Act. They&#8217;ve never debated the bill. Most of them haven&#8217;t even bothered to read it. Nevertheless, they&#8217;re going to pass it: unless we do something to stop them
> 
> Real ID is a very, very real national identification card.
> 
> This isn&#8217;t going to be easy, but we need to put the Senate on notice that if they vote for Real ID, they&#8217;re voting in favor of a National ID Card. 

I read this via [Boing Boing][2].
