[This post on Hacker News][1] discusses developers (or whoever really) including their .git folder when pushing to their production site. Not something I&#8217;ve ever had an issue with given my workflow. The HN piece linked to an article where the author discovered that some of the top 100,000 Alexa sites were including a .git folder on their live, public facing site. One of those sites is run by the Federal Communications Commission.

To check to see if you&#8217;re including a .git folder, just navigate to yourdomain.com/.git/config. Taking a look at the [FCC&#8217;s git config file][2], we can see that they&#8217;ve also [got a GitHub account][3], named **fcc-admin**! It&#8217;s a private GitHub account, though.

Because their .git folder is there, we can also see when they push new code to the fcc.gov website, via the .git/logs/HEAD file. You can [have a look at it here][4]. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if they remove this folder before too long. So, I&#8217;ve created a [public Gist containing the contents][5] of their git config file and the HEAD log file for archival purposes.
