He was present at only 28% of the Senate votes in 2003. The article states that most senators were present for more than 90% of the votes. How did this guy win the Iowa caucasus, 2004? I wouldn&#8217;t support someone who could barely make a quarter of the Senate votes in 2003. Did people overlook this fact when they decided to support him? I hope so.

This lack of attendance could possibly be blamed on campaigning. Who knows. It&#8217;s pretty bad though.
