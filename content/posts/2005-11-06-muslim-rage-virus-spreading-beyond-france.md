Doesn&#8217;t the rioting and violence in France somewhat remind you of the movie _28 Days Later_? Only the rage &#8220;virus&#8221; spreading across France and Europe is a psychological &#8220;virus&#8221; instead of the physical virus found in that movie. It&#8217;s a state of mind virus. It would be easy to confuse some of the [images coming out of France][1] with scenes in 28 Days Later.

We&#8217;re upon the 11th night of rioting in France now. So far an estimated 1300 vehicles have been torched and 350 some people have been arrested. Meanwhile [President Jacques Chirac makes worthless threats][2] of jail time for those found to be inciting violence or fear. I don&#8217;t think jail time is much of a concern for the rioters. It looks like the outraged Muslims are attempting to take over the country. Should that happen Jacques, you won&#8217;t have any prisons to put them in, nevermind losing control of your country to a Muslim population. France has to face reality here and stop fucking around and just end the damn thing. [They are at war][3] whether their administration will admit to it or not. How they should go about doing that is beyond me though. Peace offerings would just go un-noticed and using lethal force agains the rioters would just cause a much larger, _global_ Muslim backlash.

> [Across France][2], 1,300 vehicles went up in flames overnight. For the first time, more than 30 were destroyed inside the city walls of Paris. Previously quiet towns such as Dreux, to the west, and the city of Nantes were also affected.
> 
> Police said 349 people had been arrested, including six youths caught stockpiling 90 Molotov cocktails in a disused police building south of Paris.
> 
> Despite the worst destruction since the riots started, a police spokesman called for a sense of proportion: &#8220;It&#8217;s 211 districts out of 36,000, so France is not burning.&#8221;
> 
> Authorities say drug traffickers and Islamist militants are helping organize the unrest, via the Internet and mobile phones, among the North and sub-Saharan African immigrant communities who make up a significant part of many suburban housing estates.
> 
> The violence has tarnished France&#8217;s image abroad, forcing Villepin to cancel a trip to Canada, while Russia and the United States have warned their citizens to avoid troubled suburbs.

Is anybody even aware of what exactly the rioters want? [Do they feel neglected][4] or is this seriously all because of the two electrocuted teens who obviously did something to cause the police to chase them? Suppose the two electrocuted teens really are the cause for the ongoing violence. If that is the case, it would seem the Muslim population there expects to be treated differently than everyone else by law enforcement. That could also be the reasons for them feeling neglected and wanting recognition. It&#8217;s not our fault they insist on being regarded as an almost totally different species. OK, now all you anti-america whackos can start sending me nasty e-mails and leaving totally non-relavent comments. I know the point I was trying to get across in this paragraph will be totally lost on you.

And now for some links to worthwhile blog posts regarding the subject. Curt at [Flopping Aces][5] is concerned about the rest of Europe, noting that Muslims in Denmark are starting to show some signs of aggression towards the government of the land in which they are living. Let the Islamic Intifada in Denmark begin! Curt also [has a nice roundup][6] of the events occuring up until November 4th, along with some pictures.

[The Brussels Journal][7] can offer more insight than I could as to why Muslims are rioting and what to do in order to diffuse the situation. I&#8217;ve really enjoyed reading their site over the past few days. They seem to have a very unique perspective.

[The Chip Mathis Experience][8] relates the riots and general civil unrest in France to a similar situation we could soon be in here in the United States. Chip is on to something there. I&#8217;ve witnessed first hand, multiple times, how Mexicans can act when in large groups. I can&#8217;t imagine the level of violence we would see in the U.S. if we were to start sending mass quantities of illegals back to Mexico.

[Ace of Spades HQ][9] speaks of the moltov cocktail factory and proceeds to totally kill the European theory suggesting 9/11 was caused by the United States&#8217; refusal to sign the Kyoto Accords. Doesn&#8217;t make a whole lot of sense at this point in history, now does it Europe?

I&#8217;ll continue to update this post until sometime tomorrow (Monday), adding links and commentary where needed. This is linked at [Outside The Beltway][10] and [The Political Teen][11].

**UPDATE 11/6 @ 6:25 pm CST:** [Reuters][12] is reporting that Muslim rioters are now firing shots at police officers. H/T [Jihad Watch][13].

> Rioters fired shots at police in an 11th night of riots in France on Sunday, injuring 10 policemen, two of them seriously, police said.
> 
> Some 200 youths were lobbing stones and other objects at police in Grigny, south of Paris, a police spokesman said, adding that some of the rioters had fired at officers with shotguns, hitting 10 policemen.
> 
> Two officers were being treated in hospital, one with lead shot wounds to the throat, the other with wounds to a leg.
> 
> Asked whether the rioters could have killed someone, the spokesman said: &#8220;Probably not at this distance, but they could have caused bad injuries, or turn one of the officers blind.&#8221;

**UPDATE 11/6 @ 8:50 pm CST:** Jayson at [PoliPundit][14] is waiting for Michael Moore&#8217;s new documentary, he&#8217;s got some questions for the MSM and the French government too:

> When will Michael Moore produce a movie about those impoverished Muslims living in France, along with a documentary about their penchant for shooting at French authorities and burning stuff to the ground?
> 
> Will Moore refer to the Islamo-French-o-bots as “freedom fighters” or as “rebels?” 

Hopefully the use of guns won&#8217;t continue or grow worse in France. Previously, most of the violence was targetted towards non-living objects, this could mark an extremely deadly turning point in the mayhem. Here a little more info about shots fired at police officers. From Reuters via [Yahoo News][2]:

> GRIGNY, France (Reuters) &#8211; Rioters fired shots at police and set hundreds of cars ablaze in an 11th night of violence in France on Monday, hours after  
> President Jacques Chirac vowed to restore order.
> 
> Ten policemen were injured, two of them seriously, when a group of youths fired at police with shotguns in Grigny, south of Paris, police said. One officer was treated with lead shot wounds to the throat, another suffered injuries to one leg.
> 
> &#8220;They really shot at officers. This is real, serious violence. It&#8217;s not like the previous nights. I am very concerned because this is mounting,&#8221; one police officer said.
> 
> Another spokesman said the shots could probably not have been fatal due to the distance from which they were fired, but were clearly capable of causing serious injury.
> 
> Police said at least 300 cars had been set ablaze in several towns across France and 37 people had been arrested.
> 
> The fresh violence came just hours after Chirac said the law would have the last word over the riots, making his first public comments since violence started in the poor suburbs on October 27.
