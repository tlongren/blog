Crossposted from the [Slackware Blog][1].

[Lorelle has a pretty lengthy post][2] about the 1 year birthday of [wordpress.com][3]. It&#8217;s really quite a touching tribute.

> No matter how much we want “pretty” in a WordPress Theme, no matter how much we wish the sidebar were on the left instead of the right, or want to add Flickr galleries to our sidebars or posts, insert video or music files into our posts, tag posts, change header art, or wrap text around pictures, it’s all about the stories we share, the memories we recall, pictures we show off, opinions we rattle off, our screams and shouts, our whines and moans, tears openly shed, questions asked, answers challenged, and words we write.
> 
> It’s called blogging. And few do it better than the WordPress.com blogging service.

**Unique To Longren.org:** OK, I posted that on the Slackware Blog a little bit ago. This blog isn&#8217;t hosted at [wordpress.com][3], but I&#8217;ve been blogging for about 6 months there with the [Slackware Blog][4]. [There were issues][5] when I initially started using wordpress.com, but after that it&#8217;s been more stable than [Dreamhost has been lately][6]. I can see myself using wordpress.com for a long time to come, at least to see what sort of new goodies they come out with in the future. And it&#8217;s a free [WordPress][7] hosting service, doesn&#8217;t get much better than that.
