<strike>Nine</strike> Ten nights of muslims rioting in the streets so far. All due to a couple kids who got in trouble by the cops and fled to a power station. Do cops in Paris just chase people for the hell of it? I doubt it.

The protests/rioting continues to grow more violent. [250 arrests were made][1] lastnight alone, along with 900 vehicles getting torched.

> ACHERES, France &#8211; Youths armed with gasoline bombs fanned out from Paris&#8217; poor, troubled suburbs to shatter the tranquility of leafier towns, torching 900 vehicles, a nursery school and other targets, police said Saturday, in the worst wave of arson since the urban violence began more than a week ago.
> 
> Police were forced to adapt, deploying a helicopter and small teams of officers to chase down youths who sped from one attack to another in cars and on motorbikes. The new security tactics yielded more than 250 arrests during the ninth straight night of unrest.
> 
> The violence, which was originally concentrated in neighborhoods northeast of Paris with large immigrant populations, is forcing France to confront anger long-simmering in its suburbs, where many Africans and their French-born children live on society&#8217;s margins, struggling with unemployment, poor housing, racial discrimination, crime and a lack of opportunities.

The really bad thing here is the French government is pretty much helpless in getting the violence under control. Supposedly, some muslim groups are [attempting to intervene][2], prolly just gonna issue a &#8220;fatwa&#8221; or two. We all know how that goes.

[Weapons of Mass Destruction][3] has a huge post covering the riots. They&#8217;re guessing that bringing an end to the riots may be the easy part for the French government.

[A Blog for All][4] notes the headlines here in the U.S. Not really much to be seen about the violence in France due to [anti-american/bush protests][5] going on in Argentina. That&#8217;s the liberal media for you. Gladly accepting all opportunities to bash Bush instead of covering stories that could have a major impact on all society. [Israpundit][6] says the English media is downplaying the violence in France too. You&#8217;d think they&#8217;d be a lot more gunshy considering what went down last July in London.

[The Brussels Journal][7] foresees the fall of France as we knew it. Could the voilence get to a point in which France is simply divided up? Seems unlikely, but anything can happen. [Jihad Watch][8] has more on the two-state solution.

> These areas, which some compare to the ‚Äúmillet‚Äù system of the former Ottoman Empire, where each religious community (millet) conducted its own social and cultural life in its own neighbourhoods, exist not only in France, but also in Muslim neighbourhoods in Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and other countries.

Dan over at [Riehl World View][9] explains with great simplicity what&#8217;s going on and how fucking sad it is.

> Whatever the circumstances &#8211; groups of thugs are rioting and destroying schools, warehouses and vehicles and the Prime Minister has them in for a chat. And this is one of the nation&#8217;s John Kerry was going to depend on for help in Iraq?

That is what it all boils down to in the end, groups of thugs bringing destruction and chaos for basically no reason at all. Fuckin kids shouldn&#8217;t have been running from the cops anyway. And like I said before, cops don&#8217;t chase people for no reason at all, they obviously did something to provoke the chase.

[The Counterterrorism Blog][10] quotes a police-union leader who seems to be quite worried, for good reason mind you.

> A civil war is unfolding in Clichy-sous-Bois. We cannot handle the challenge any longer. Only the Army, trained and equipped for this type of mission, can intervene to stabilize the situation.

James Joyner at [Outside The Beltway][11] has various news clippings detailing lastnights events, as does [Captains Quarters][12].

[Peaktalk][18]

**UPDATE 1:** [Jo looks at the definition][30] of &#8220;rioting&#8221; and asks why it happens. I think she&#8217;s having trouble answering the same question I am: what the hell do the rioters think they&#8217;ll accomplish? Or, a more generic question would be &#8220;what&#8217;s the point?&#8221; I can&#8217;t wrap my mind around it. Perhaps if I were to go live in a Muslim society for a few months I would understand more&#8230;

[Weapons of Mass Destruction][31] started a new post on the subject due to the others getting too large and cluttered. I hate it when that happens&#8230;

**UPDATE 2:** Smantix over at [Six Meat Buffet][32] says &#8220;Death To France.&#8221; I think he may be onto something there&#8230;

> When Hurricane Katrina nailed New Orleans, the French were kind enough to offer us a couple of generators and some cots. Let‚Äôs send them a hose or something. America‚Äôs Oldest Enemy deserves no less.

And my man Dan over at [Riehl World View][33] thinks I sound pissed. Did this post come across that way? It should have because I am pissed. The whole situation in France isn&#8217;t necessary and the damn kids obviously did something to provoke the cops. And the poor, oppressed, Muslim society acts like half of their population was wiped out by a nuke or something. Grow up Islam. I&#8217;ll gladly welcome you into the 21st century once you get your shit straight.
