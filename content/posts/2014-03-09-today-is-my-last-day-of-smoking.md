## I&#8217;ve been a smoker for 10+ years {.subtitle}

I&#8217;ve been wanting to stop for long time now. I tried the e-cigarettes, but they just didn&#8217;t do it for me. Gum, patches, pretty much everything else. I don&#8217;t smoke just for nicotine, as explained below.

My brother and his girlfriend recently quit, after calling [Quitline Iowa][1]. That was about two months ago and they&#8217;re still smoke free, which is awesome. I called the Iowa Quitline a few weeks ago and got a bunch of nicotine patches, and tomorrow, March 10, is my quit date. So, today is my last day of smoking!

I&#8217;m kind of anxious about how tomorrow will go. The first thing I do when I wake up in the morning is smoke a cigarette, and that&#8217;s gonna be hard not to do. I&#8217;ll put a patch on instead first thing after waking up.

I&#8217;m not anxious about not having the nicotine, as I&#8217;ll get it via a patch, but I mostly smoke just for something to do. It&#8217;s become a reason for me to go outside and get away from things for a few minutes. So, the anxiety comes mostly from wondering how exactly to break from this routine of going out for a smoke every 1.5-2 hours.

I&#8217;m not sure exactly what I&#8217;ll do to get past that. Probably just stay super busy, which I am, thankfully. It&#8217;s for sure going to be a difficult routine to break. I&#8217;d gladly accept any tips or ideas from ex-smokers on how to get past my urge to go outside and smoke, just for the sake of going outside for a few minutes.

I&#8217;ll update with more posts as I progress, and, hopefully, will have a post up on Tuesday about how I&#8217;ve been smoke free for one whole day!

Wish me luck, I&#8217;ll need it.
