I got a pre-release of the new, self-titled Deftones album. So far, I like it really well. I like it a lot better than I liked White Pony (although that was a pretty good album too). The new cd has some pretty melodic tunes that have a kind of dark sound.

Go buy this cd, it comes out on May 19. I&#8217;m gonna go buy it just to own a &#8220;real&#8221; copy.
