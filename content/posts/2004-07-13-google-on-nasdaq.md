Looks like [Google][1] is getting closer to their IPO. I&#8217;d be interested in purchasing some of their stock. I mean, it has to be a fairly safe bet, I&#8217;d be 95% of the American population knows about google. It&#8217;s not even just a noun anymore, it&#8217;s verb! Anyway, it looks like google will be trading its shares via Nasdaq, I had a feeling it would end up being traded on Nasdaq as opposed to the NYSE, which many people had favored.
