I came across [this list][1] of voice commands for Kinect on the Xbox 360.

I wanted to document them here as well for future reference. I also get quite a bit of traffic related to Xbox 360 stuff, so someone else reading might find it useful.

Please be aware that this is not a complete list. This list mostly covers voice commands that let you interact with the Xbox 360 Dashboard, not specific games. There are, however, voice commands for some apps: Hulu Plus, Last.fm, Netflix, ESPN and Zune.

**You need to say &#8220;Xbox&#8221; before saying these voice commands.**

> Open Tray (only if there&#8217;s no disc inserted) -> Opens Tray  
> Kinect -> Opens Kinect Hub  
> Dashboard -> Takes you back to dashboard  
> ESPN -> Starts ESPN  
> Zune -> Starts Zune Marketplace  
> Video Kinect -> Starts Video Kinect  
> Trailer -> Starts Trailer  
> Dance Central -> Starts Game trailer  
> Play Game (disc) -> launches game  
> Next &#8211; > Takes you to next blade  
> Previous -> Takes you to previous blade  
> Sign In -> Signs you in  
> Achievements -> shows lists of achievements  
> friends -> shows friendslist  
> Face Id -> starts Face ID  
> Yes  
> Cancel  
> No  
> Last Fm -> Starts Last FM

**Voice Commands In Last FM:**

> Love -> hearts song  
> Ban &#8211; > bans song  
> next -> skips song  
> play -> plays playlist

**Voice Commands for Last FM, Hulu Plus, Netflix, ESPN and Zune**

> fast-forward -> Fast forward a video or song  
> rewind -> Rewind a video or song  
> pause -> Pause video or song  
> play -> Play a video or song  
> next -> Skip to next video or song  
> previous -> Skip to previous video or song

[ad]  
If you&#8217;re aware of any voice commands that are missing, please leave a comment describing the voice command and I&#8217;ll get it added to this page.

**UPDATE 1/3/2011:**  
I just came across the [official Xbox Support][2] &#8220;How to control your Xbox 360 console by using your voice&#8221; page. It doesn&#8217;t list all the voice commands listed above, hopefully they will update it with all the voice commands at some point.

**UPDATE 1/17/2012:**  
Martyn Herb [left a comment with a tip][3] on how to turn your Xbox 360 off via a Kinect voice command. Before you can turn your Xbox 360 off, you need to say &#8220;Go to settings&#8221;. Once you&#8217;re at the system settings panel, you can then say &#8220;xbox turn off&#8221; to shut your Xbox 360 down.
