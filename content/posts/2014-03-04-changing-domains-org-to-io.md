## Maybe Google won&#8217;t hate me anymore {.subtitle}

A bunch of scummy sites are using some of my old WordPress themes. The themes have links to longren.org in the footer, I think Google hates me for it, I dunno though. It started about 3 years ago. When all was good, organic search referrals from [Google][1] were around 15,000 unique visitors per month.

Now, however, the story is much different. In all, Google is throwing me about 800 unique visitors a month from organic search. I believe it has something to do with all of the incoming links to longren.org from low quality websites. I really have no idea though and am not about to hire some SEO company to fix it up or take the time to [disavow][2] hundreds of thousands of links.

I&#8217;ve got longren.org forwarding to longren.io now, but will eventually turn that off and just start from scratch, I guess. Unless Google can help, but that&#8217;s not probably likely.

Oh well. Only change will be the new .io TLD. It&#8217;ll be nice having a new domain, even though I&#8217;ll keep the old one around forever most likely.

Doing the forwarding so <longren.org/work-with-me/> will end up at <longren.io/work-with-me/> with 301 redirects all around. This is all that was needed in the `.htaccess` file.

<pre class="lang:default decode:true " >Redirect 301 / http://longren.io/</pre>

<div class="wpulike wpulike-default " >
  <div class="wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked">
    <button type="button"
					aria-label="Like Button"
					data-ulike-id="5771"
					data-ulike-nonce="ea7b89a9e9"
					data-ulike-type="likeThis"
					data-ulike-template="wpulike-default"
					data-ulike-display-likers="0"
					data-ulike-disable-pophover="0"
					class="wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_likethis_5771"></button><span class="count-box"></span>
