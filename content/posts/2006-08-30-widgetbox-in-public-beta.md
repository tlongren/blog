[This Widgetbox service][1] looks very promising. It&#8217;s an online directory of web widgets for blogs or other web sites. Similar to Apple and Yahoo Widgets, except [these are for the web][2].

Widgetbox also has a section where developers can submit their own widgets for others to download and use. They also have a feature that allows you to quickly manage widgets you&#8217;ve already installed.

Widgetbox is currently free and will probably always be. As the service matures, they&#8217;re likely to add more features that will be available only after paying a fee for that feature. It&#8217;s a really neat service, one that looks like it will definitely become more popular as word gets out.
