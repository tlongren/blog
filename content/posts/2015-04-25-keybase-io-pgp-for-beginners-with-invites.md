## PGP for Beginners: A Simple Web Interface to PGP

[Keybase.io][1] is quite simple, basically a web interface and command line client that makes PGP more user-friendly. At the same time, it makes it easy to get someones public key, and know it&#8217;s the correct key.

[Keybase.io][1] allows you to encrypt, decrypt, sign, and verify messages to other keybase.io users. The [Keybase.io homepage][1] has an excellent description on the inner workings and how to make use of the command line client.

<div class="wp-block-image">
  <figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/longren.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/keybase-tyler.png?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="568" src="https://i2.wp.com/longren.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/keybase-tyler-1024x568.png?resize=1024%2C568" alt="keybase-tyler" class="wp-image-8027" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.longren.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/keybase-tyler.png?resize=1024%2C568&ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/www.longren.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/keybase-tyler.png?resize=150%2C83&ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/www.longren.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/keybase-tyler.png?resize=300%2C166&ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.longren.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/keybase-tyler.png?resize=700%2C388&ssl=1 700w, https://i0.wp.com/www.longren.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/keybase-tyler.png?w=1193&ssl=1 1193w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></figure>
</div>

You can [find me on Keybase.io][2] at <https://keybase.io/tlongren/>.  


I like how the purpose of the Keybase.io website, as opposed to the command line client, is described:

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <p>
    Keybase.io is also a Keybase client, however certain crypto actions (signing and decrypting) are limited to users who store client-encrypted copies of their private keys on the server, an optional feature we didn&#8217;t mention above.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    On the website, all crypto is performed in JavaScript, in your browser. Some people have strong feelings about this, for good reason.
  </p>
</blockquote>

Keybase.io has it&#8217;s issues, though. [Liz Denys][3] makes very [good points in her _Refusing To Verify Myself_ post][4].

And back in March 2014, [Evan Johnson][5] discovered [very serious vulnerability][6] in Keybase.io. You can read more about it, along with examples and why it was so major, [in his blog post][7].

There&#8217;s still serious debate that&#8217;s somewhat related to Evan&#8217;s discovery. An [issue on GitHub is still open][8] while the Keybase.io folks [consider their options and best course of action][9].

Everything has it&#8217;s flaws, though. So for me, Keybase.io is an easy way for me to communicate securely with those I need to do so with. I&#8217;ll likely continue using it, but need more people I communicate with frequently to be members.

### Invites

I do have invites for Keybase.io. I&#8217;ll only send them to people I know. If you&#8217;re a regular here, a client of mine, or old online friend, you qualify. Real world friends and family obviously qualify.

Just ask in the [comments below][10].

  <div class="wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked">
