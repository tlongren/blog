Yesterday was my 21st birthday. Went out lastnight and picked up a 6 pack of Budweiser bottles and Rumple Minze. Rumple Minze is a 100 proof peppermint flavored schnapps. We just drink it straight, but I&#8217;ve heard of lots of drink mixes that it&#8217;s used in.

I&#8217;m not creating any new FTP accounts for the rest of the week. When the current people with FTP acconts are done downloading what they want, I&#8217;ll give out a few more. I&#8217;ve had to limit the maximum download speed from my FTP to 5kb/sec. Can&#8217;t have you people sucking up all my bandwidth. ðŸ˜‰

I also heard a rumor that it&#8217;s possible we may hear [DJ Pi][1] on [di.fm][2] soon. That would be killer! [dj GT][3] and his brother, Project C, are coming out with a 4 disc set soon. I&#8217;m supposed to be getting it soon so I can help seed it via BitTorrent once it&#8217;s available to the public. I&#8217;ve seen the tracklist for it and I think it&#8217;s gonna be an awesome mix.
