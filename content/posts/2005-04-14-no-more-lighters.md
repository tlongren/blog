Lighters have now been banned from passenger flights. You can have up to 10 backup match books though, they have to be in your carry-on. Why do they let people take stuff that could be &#8220;dangerous&#8221; on their carry-on? They have more access to it that way. I think they should just make people put their lighters, knives, and nail clippers in their checked luggage, that way they can&#8217;t access any of those items while in flight.

And what&#8217;s someone gonna do with a lighter? Light my ass on fire? I sure hope so. But seriously, what life threatening damage could be done with a simple Bic lighter? I guess it could be punctured and possibly persuaded to explode. It could also be filed down to resemble an ice-pick, which could be used to gouge eyes.

I&#8217;m sure these items can&#8217;t be checked because they could be fitted with a remotely detonated explosive or some bull shit like that. I could also have 3 sticks of dynamite up my ass though&#8230;

I swear to god, some people need to learn how to use their brain in a more efficient manner. I think my logic above makes pretty good sense. To me, letting people put &#8220;dangerous&#8221; items such as nail clippers, lighters, and pocket knives in their checked luggage makes much more sense than just outright banning everything that could be used in anyway as a weapon. But that&#8217;s just what me and a lot of other Americans think. But our opinions don&#8217;t matter anymore.

Update: I heard about this on the news this morning before going to work. I then proceeded to read this article:  
<http://apnews.myway.com/article/20050414/D89F78980.html>

It states that lighters are the only item totally banned from airplanes. Items like guns and knives can be stored in checked luggage. Lighters are a no-no everywhere though for some reason. And their reasoning for not having lighters in checked luggage does make sense.
