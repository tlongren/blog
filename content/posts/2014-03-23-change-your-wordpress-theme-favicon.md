## Really easy to do, but rarely done {.subtitle}

Not sure how to create your favicon? I typically use GIMP, along with [this tutorial][1]. It has some good info on creating &#8220;proper&#8221; favicons, too, so it&#8217;s a worthwhile read even if you aren&#8217;t creating a favicon at the moment.

I like [X-Icon Editor][2], too (it&#8217;s in the screenshot attached to this post), and there&#8217;s [tons][3] [of][4] [converters][5] for creating `.ico` favicon files.

Just add this modify the following and add it to your theme&#8217;s functions.php file, or add it to your [WordPress functionality plugin][6].

<pre class="lang:php decode:true " >function my_favicon() { ?&gt;
&lt;link rel="shortcut icon" href="/path/to/favicon.ico" &gt;
&lt;?php }
add_action('wp_head', 'my_favicon');</pre>

Change `/path/to/favicon.ico` to point to your `favicon.ico` file and you&#8217;re done! 

<div class="wpulike wpulike-default " >
  <div class="wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked">
    <button type="button"
					aria-label="Like Button"
					data-ulike-id="5779"
					data-ulike-nonce="7a3f3ce8d4"
					data-ulike-type="likeThis"
					data-ulike-template="wpulike-default"
					data-ulike-display-likers="0"
