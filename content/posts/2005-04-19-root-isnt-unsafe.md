I&#8217;ve always disputed this as I typically run as root when using my linux boxes. Now, when using [Gnome][1] or some other UI, I&#8217;ll use my regular user.

Michael Robertson, CEO of [Linspire][2], has come to my defense (sort of): &#8220;I defy anybody to tell me why is it more secure to not run as root. Nobody really has a good answer. They say &#8216;oh, yeah, it is!&#8217;, but it really isn&#8217;t.&#8221;

I&#8217;ve heard so many people talk about the dangers of running as root all the time. There are dangers, such as accidentally &#8220;rm -rf /some/important/dir/&#8221;, but if you can type, that shouldn&#8217;t be an issue. I&#8217;ve never accidentally removed a folder or file I need. If you&#8217;re prone to do things like that, you shouldn&#8217;t have a root account anyway.

BTW, I saw this on [Slashdot][3] this morning:

<div class="wpulike wpulike-default " >
  <div class="wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked">
    <button type="button"
					aria-label="Like Button"
					data-ulike-id="1800"
					data-ulike-nonce="badf6c224b"
					data-ulike-type="likeThis"
					data-ulike-template="wpulike-default"
					data-ulike-display-likers="0"
					data-ulike-disable-pophover="0"
					class="wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_likethis_1800"></button><span class="count-box"></span>
