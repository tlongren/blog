Rapper 50 Cent, has come to the defense of President George Bush in relation to Kanye Wests slanderous comments about Bush and the Katrina response. Way to go fiddy! I don&#8217;t think anyone saw that one coming, from 50 especially.

> [Rapper 50 CENT has lashed out][1] at fellow hip-hop star KANYE WEST for accusing US President GEORGE W BUSH of racism in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.
> 
> The IN DA CLUB star believes human intervention could not have prevented the effects of the hurricane, which killed over a thousand people in the US gulf states in August (05), and sees no point in reprimanding the President for something which was beyond his control.
> 
> He says, &#8220;The New Orleans disaster was meant to happen. It was an act of God.
> 
> &#8220;I think people responded to it the best way they can.
> 
> &#8220;What KANYE WEST was saying, I don&#8217;t know where that came from.&#8221; 

Put that dumb ass, racist, hill-billy wannabe Kanye in his place. See [the Jawa Report][2], [Don Surbur][3], [The Blue State Conservatives][4], [The Museum of Left Wing Lunacy][5], and [In The Bullpen][6] for more commentary.
