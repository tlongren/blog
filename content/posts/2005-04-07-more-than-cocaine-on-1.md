The [USA Network][1] is launching a new miniseries based on the movie _&#8220;Traffic&#8221;_. Traffic is a movie about coke, the dealers, users and money. As most people know, trace amounts of cocaine can be found on most bills.

The USA Network is putting little stickers on 50,000 $1 dollar bills promoting the new Traffic miniseries, to be distributed at trendy bars in L.A. and New York. They&#8217;re working with GoGorilla, a guerilla marketing firm. I remember when IBM hired one of those firms to grafitti tux (linux logo) all over city streets. Very funny.

I&#8217;d kinda like to get me a job with one of these guerilla marketing firms. I have no doubt I could come up with some wicked promotional ideas.

Here&#8217;s the article at CNN:
