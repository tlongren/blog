Yay! It&#8217;s 2005. I didn&#8217;t do anything too special for the new year.

It rained ice most of the morning here today. It was great. We&#8217;re supposedly gonna get 10-12&#8243; of snow tuesday through wednesday this week. I dunno if I believe it though, the weather people here seem to be off lately.

Work is crazy. Now that we&#8217;re through the holiday season, people are starting their diets up again. Which is good news for us, nevermind the huge influx of orders catching us a little off-guard.

No-ip&#8217;s service is again restored. They were experiencing some sort of DoS attack that knocked down their mail servers for a while yesterday.

Demonoid.com is gone for good everyone. I wasn&#8217;t a user of the site. It sucked in my opinion. Suprnova is releasing [eXeem][1] soon, their new software. It&#8217;s some sort of mesh between BitTorrent and Kazaa I&#8217;m afraid. I dun expect I&#8217;ll like it too well&#8230;
