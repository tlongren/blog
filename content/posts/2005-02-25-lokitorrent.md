I posted a link to the lokitorrent page with the &#8220;Inappropriate for all ages&#8221; image. There&#8217;s rumors going around that there never was a lawsuit against lokitorrent. I&#8217;m skeptical though.

Supposedly, the owner of lokitorrent created all this lawsuit business in order to get dontations from his sites users. After raising a decent ammount of money, he skipped the country. The lawsuit was supposedly filed in Dallas. When the MPAA is in Cali and lokitorrent is hosted in D.C. So a lawsuit in Dallas doesn&#8217;t really make any sense. The lokitorrent page still points to it&#8217;s original server. I would have thought the MPAA would alter the sites name servers to have it point to one of their servers. That&#8217;s not the case.

The only thing that confuses me is uk-torrents.com. I used uk-torrents a little, upon visiting their site one day, I was redirected to the lokitorrent page with the &#8220;Inappropriate for all ages&#8221; image. I don&#8217;t know why uk-torrents would voluntarily redirect their site to that page. And now, a visit to uk-torrents.com shows it&#8217;s just a page with a bunch of ads.

I&#8217;m beginning to think this was all a hoax to draw donations from the users of these sites. I saw this on slashdot originally:
