Isn&#8217;t it about time for Beta 1 of Slackware 11 to be released? I&#8217;d surely think so, especially with [all the updates][1] [being made][2] to the slackware-current changelog lately. I was thinking that Patrick would take a chance and make 2.6 the default kernel in Slackware 11, I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;ll happen now. 2.4.32 or 2.4.33 will most likely be the default kernel found in Slackware 11. I say this due to the changes that have been made to the kernel 2.4.32 packages in -current.

I&#8217;ll continue waiting patiently for Slackware 11 Beta 1&#8230;
