The stable release of <a href=http://www.php.net/downloads.php#v5>PHP 5.0.0</a> has been out for a little while now, since July 13th. I compiled and started using it on the 14th I think. I was glad to see that there&#8217;s a <a href=http://www.hardened-php.net>hardened-php</a> patch for PHP 5.0.0 already.

I tried using the <a href=http://www.grsecurity.net>grsecurity</a> kernel patch for a while but it would cause my network card that&#8217;s connected to the internet to go down, for some reason. I think the grsecurity patch was blocking access to something in /proc. I dunno, I&#8217;ll probably mess around with it a little later on.
