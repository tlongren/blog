His trial has begun, and the first part has ended. It will resume on [Nov. 28 per Saddams request][1]. In this first round, [Saddam pleaded not guilty][2] to murder and torture charges coming from a massacre in 1982.

> BAGHDAD, Iraq &#8212; The first session of Saddam Hussein&#8217;s trial has ended. It will resume on Nov. 28.
> 
> Saddam pleaded not guilty Wednesday to charges including murder and torture in a 1982 massacre.
> 
> Saddam Hussein still insists he is president of Iraq, as trial began on charges that could lead to his execution.
> 
> He was in a defiant mood Wednesday.
> 
> The toppled Iraqi leader stood and asked the presiding judge: &#8220;Who are you? I want to know who you are.&#8221; Then he declared himself the president of Iraq.
> 
> When the Kurdish judge tried to get Saddam to formally identify himself, Saddam refused. He said: &#8220;I do not recognize the body that has authorized you and I don&#8217;t recognize this aggression.&#8221;
> 
> He went on to say: &#8220;I do not respond to this so-called court, with all due respect.&#8221;
> 
> The presiding judge read Saddam&#8217;s name, calling him the &#8220;former president of Iraq.&#8221; But Saddam protested, insisting he still is president.

That&#8217;s all fine and dandy. He can claim whatever he wants, everyone living in reality knows it&#8217;s not true. You can get some background info on the 1982 massacre over at [the Boston Globe][3].

Brent, over at [NewsBusters][4] has a nice piece discussing a lot of Saddam-friendly news reporting coming from the major news networks. I wish they&#8217;d just shut up, of course he&#8217;s not going to get a fair trial. He murdered thousands of people, he doesn&#8217;t deserve a fair trial. He doesn&#8217;t even deserve a trial.

Matt from [Blogs for Bush][5] wonders if Saddam is &#8221; the Left&#8217;s new Mumia.&#8221; [Michelle Malkin][6] covers pretty much every angle, as expected. [UrbanGrounds][7] speaks of loony liberals and their willingness to believe anything anti-america related. Chad Evans (In The Bullpen) has a great [overall analysis][8]. [Outside The Beltway][9] discusses Saddams little scuffle with the guards. [The Political Teen][10] has some video .

Other coverage coming from [bRight & Early][11], [Sister Toldjah][12], [Don Surber][13], and [California Conservative][14].
