I started tracking [about one year ago][2] when I first started using [Mint][3].

I thought it&#8217;d be 2+ years before I saw 20,000 unique visitors, guess I was way off. I never anticipated releasing a theme for WordPress or joining some of the blogging communities I&#8217;m a member of. Yay for 20,000! I&#8217;ll be at 40,000 uniques by early May, hopefully.
