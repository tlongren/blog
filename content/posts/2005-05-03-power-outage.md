The entire city of Nevada had a power outage today. It lasted about 4 hours at work, so I went down to Ankeny to do some work there. Power was out at home for an hour or so.

Our phone system went down at work because the UPS it was running off of ran out of power. Today is a big day for people calling orders in too because it&#8217;s the last day of ordering for deliveries next week. Our call center girls are gonna be working till about 9:00 tonight calling clients to get orders. I don&#8217;t know what we&#8217;re gonna do about a production schedule yet. We&#8217;re either gonna have to project numbers, which we usually don&#8217;t do for this line, or wait till tomorrow or late tonight to push out a production schedule. The kitchen is in need of work though, so I imagine we&#8217;ll just project.
