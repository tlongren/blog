I [wrote about the Technorati beta][1] a while ago. Well, it&#8217;s finally come out of beta and is now acting as the main Technorati page. I really like the new site, very pretty. The [Technorati Weblog][2] [announced the new site yesterday][3].

They have a list of new features and changes in that post. I would mention some, but you should just visit the [Technorati Weblog announcement][3].

[New Links says][4] last time Technorati switched sites, the entire service was broken for a while. The Blog Herald [points out][5] that the new design brings a much needed modern look.

And on another note, the actual Technorati site seems to be going really slow. I noticed that sometimes even with their old site. I can&#8217;t imagine this new site will speed things up much. I wonder what the cause of the slowness is. It&#8217;s really bad sometimes.
