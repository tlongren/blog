I found out that [FlipHost][1] offers access to server stats through an [API developed by SolusVM][2]. It offers all the stuff you&#8217;d want to know about your VPS. Disk usage, RAM usage, bandwidth usage, but I don&#8217;t think it does any cpu load reporting, unfortunately.

I put [together a simple site][3] to quickly tell if all my stuff at FlipHost was online. I could have gone the pinging the VPS IP route, but since there was an API available, I might as well use it. And pinging a host wouldn&#8217;t give all these details.

If you have a VPS from FlipHost, you can generate your API key and API hash from your SolusVM Control Panel, in the &#8220;api&#8221; tab. **If you don&#8217;t use FlipHost**, but your host does use SolusVM, this should work for you too. The **API client URL for FlipHost** is: _https://solus.fliphost.net/api/client_. The SolusVM client API suggests the client URL is run on port 5656, but FlipHost has directed port 80 and 443 there instead.

The site is [available on Github][4], so you can easily make your own status page. I&#8217;ll be adding more to it, as there&#8217;s only really one action being taken currently. As a demo, I&#8217;ve put it up at <http://status.longren.org/>, which is [hosted on Heroku][5]. It also looks nice on mobile devices. Have a look at the screenshots in the gallery at the end of this post.

You should be able to deploy this on [Heroku][6] just like any other app. Just [fork it on Github][4], make a local clone of your forked repo, edit config.php, setup your Heroku git remote, and push to Heroku. You&#8217;ll want to [install the Heroku Toolbelt app][7]. The [Heroku Dev Center][8] is a great resource if you&#8217;re new to Heroku.

For a more detailed explanation on setting this up on Heroku, you&#8217;ll want to read _[How-To: Monitor VPS Status from Heroku][9]_.
