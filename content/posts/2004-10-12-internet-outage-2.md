This website was down yesterday for about 6+ hours. There was guys working on the roads around here yesterday and they must have cut some fiber. As I was driving to Ames lastnight around 7:30, I saw about 10 Mediacom vans in the ditch, with a bunch of flood lights. I assume they were there to fix the break.

But, it&#8217;s back now and everything is good. I need to do some work on this machine real soon. The 2.6 linux kernel doesn&#8217;t want to work well on it, at all.
