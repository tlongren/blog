This mix was supposed to be released on 9/11. It wasn&#8217;t though, due to the fact that I never got any cover artwork from Artik.

DJ Pi contacted me via MSN yesterday and told me to release it without the cover artwork. Pi&#8217;s still gone (on vacation, emergency, I dunno), he&#8217;ll be gone for another 10 days.

Anyway, I released this mix today. Quite good. It&#8217;s a memorial for the family and victims of 9/11. It&#8217;s great to see a DJ (who&#8217;s French) offer their support.

This is a great mix. You should download it:
