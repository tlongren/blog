[Flatland][1], and a derivative theme, [Flatland-Alt][2], are a couple beautiful Sublime Text themes. [Flatland is available on Package Control][3], however, Flatland-Alt must be installed manually, as it&#8217;s not on Package Control yet.

To manually install the Flatland-Alt theme, here&#8217;s the instructions from the README at GitHub:

## Installation

Flatland-Alt is a Sublime package. Currently, you must install it manually.

  1. [Download the theme files][4]
  2. Unzip the files and rename the newly created folder to `flatland-alt`
  3. Copy the folder into the Sublime Text Packages folder. On a Mac that&#8217;s located at Library > Application Support > Sublime Text > Packages. You can find that directory by selecting Preferences > Browse Packages&#8230;

If you&#8217;re on Linux, rename the `flatland-alt-master` folder to `flatland-master` and move it to `~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/`.

Flatland-Alt is different from the original Flatland in a few ways, most noticeably is the red color instead of blue. Flatland-Alt also only comes with a dark version and there&#8217;s only square tabs. The orange accent color in Flatland-Alt is a nice compliment to the default [Numix GTK theme][5] color. 

## Here&#8217;s Flatland

## And here&#8217;s Flatland-Alt

[<img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/longren.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/flatland-alt-crushed-1024x562.png?resize=700%2C384&#038;ssl=1" alt="Flatland-Alt" width="700" height="384" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5400" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.longren.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/flatland-alt-crushed.png?resize=1024%2C562&ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/www.longren.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/flatland-alt-crushed.png?resize=300%2C164&ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.longren.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/flatland-alt-crushed.png?w=1920&ssl=1 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-recalc-dims="1" />][7]

Both are very nice themes in my opinion, and I&#8217;ve used them both before, although not for long periods of time. I just [love Spacefunk][8].

<div id="polls-14-loading" class="wp-polls-loading">
  <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.longren.io/wp-content/plugins/wp-polls/images/loading.gif?resize=16%2C16&#038;ssl=1" width="16" height="16" alt="Loading ..." title="Loading ..." class="wp-polls-image" data-recalc-dims="1" />&nbsp;Loading ...
</div>

I&#8217;ll be posting a few more beautiful Sublime Text themes in the next few days, it&#8217;s amazing how many relatively unknown themes are out there, that aren&#8217;t total crap. You can probably tell I enjoy rather minimalistic themes with flat, dark colors, and large tabs (sometimes).

Know of any worthy Sublime Text themes I should check out?
