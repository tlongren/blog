I still love [Sublime Text][1]. I made a post a while ago about some of [my favorite Sublime Text themes][2]. Since then, I&#8217;ve got a new favorite, [Spacefunk][3], by [Twiebie][4].

I like it a lot because it has a gray variation instead of the dark bluish color. However, it does have the dark blue color scheme available, too. You can install it [via Package Control][5].

Spacefunk is based on the [Spacegray theme][6] from [kkga][7] and comes with two color schemes, Blue Monday, and Gray Tuesday. A screenshot of Blue Monday is below.  
[<img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/longren.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/bluemonday-1024x620.png?resize=700%2C423&#038;ssl=1" alt="bluemonday" width="700" height="423" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5341" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.longren.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/bluemonday.png?resize=1024%2C620&ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/www.longren.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/bluemonday.png?resize=300%2C181&ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.longren.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/bluemonday.png?w=1394&ssl=1 1394w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-recalc-dims="1" />][8]

More [screenshots can be seen at the GitHub repository][3]. Just search for `Spacefunk` in Package Control to install it. To activate Blue Monday, add this to your user preferences file:

<pre class="lang:default decode:true " >{
  "theme": "Spacefunk (Blue Monday).sublime-theme",
  "color_scheme": "Packages/Theme - Spacefunk/Future Funk (Blue Monday).tmTheme"
}</pre>

For the Gray Tuesday scheme, add this to your user preferences file:

<pre class="lang:default decode:true " >{
  "theme": "Spacefunk (Grey Tuesday).sublime-theme",
  "color_scheme": "Packages/Theme - Spacefunk/Future Funk (Grey Tuesday).tmTheme"
}</pre>

There&#8217;s other customization you can apply too. For a light colored sidebar, add this to your user preferences file:

<pre class="lang:default decode:true " >{
  "spacefunk_sidebar_light": true
}</pre>

Spacefunk is the Sublime Text theme I&#8217;m using on every machine I use now. The Gray Tuesday scheme is exactly what I&#8217;ve been looking for. Dark blue schemes seem to be very popular in the Sublime Text community, so it&#8217;s difficult to find other color schemes that look nice.

<div id="polls-14" class="wp-polls">
</div>

<div id="polls-14-loading" class="wp-polls-loading">
  <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.longren.io/wp-content/plugins/wp-polls/images/loading.gif?resize=16%2C16&#038;ssl=1" width="16" height="16" alt="Loading ..." title="Loading ..." class="wp-polls-image" data-recalc-dims="1" />&nbsp;Loading ...
</div>

Needless to say, I&#8217;ll probably be sticking with Spacefunk for a while. And if you&#8217;re a fan of Spacegray, you should give Spacefunk a try, you&#8217;ll probably enjoy it.
