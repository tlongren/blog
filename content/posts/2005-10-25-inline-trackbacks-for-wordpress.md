For the last few days I&#8217;ve been searching all over the place for a plugin to do inline trackbacks. I&#8217;ve got em now, you&#8217;ll see what I&#8217;m talking about at the end of a few posts here on the main page.

[Simply Kimberly][1] had a plugin, but a 404 is recieved upon trying to download. Luckily, [Slobokan][2] came to fill the 404 void. Actually, Slobokan noticed Kimberly&#8217;s original plugin wasn&#8217;t counting pingbacks, only trackbacks. He took it upon himself, much to my pleasure, to fix the plugin to include pingbacks and trackbacks. Now, that&#8217;s something I could have done, but I wouldn&#8217;t have written a plugin. I&#8217;d have just hacked some PHP into my index.php file. The problem with me doing that is I&#8217;ll forget what I&#8217;d done eventually and would just confuse myself.

I hacked inline trackbacks into the last WordPress theme I was using, it was dirty and I don&#8217;t want to do it again. I don&#8217;t see a point in re-inventing the wheel when numerous people probably already have re-invented &#8220;the wheel&#8221;.

So, all you WordPress folks out there that&#8217;ve been wanting inline trackbacks, hit up [Slobokan&#8217;s site][2] and download. If you&#8217;re not familiar with PHP, don&#8217;t worry. Installation is extremely easy.

Perhaps I&#8217;ll throw a couple trackback parties soon. Not sure though, the amount of traffic that seems to be generated by those makes me a little nervous. Bandwidth is an issue for me unfortunately.
