Unwakeable 1.2 will be released shortly after January 1, 2007. I haven&#8217;t had much time the last two weeks to do much work on it. I could release it now, but I haven&#8217;t written the php to convert the old K2 options over to the new Unwakeable-specific options.

Some changes in 1.2 will include displaying post ratings, post views, and Digg Integrator on pages instead of only on posts. I&#8217;ve also added some css for displaying a changelog like the one I have on the [Unwakeable page][1]. Also, I need to test out [Gregarious][2] and get support for that plugin built in, if there&#8217;s any need to build support for it at all. Gregarious replaces Digg This Reloaded, it also makes use of the new Digg API.

I&#8217;ve been incredibly busy at work the last two weeks, we&#8217;ve migrated from Access to Microsoft SQL Server. It&#8217;s so much nicer to work with. Also, Ashley and I are going to Wisconsin on Friday to visit my dad and step-mom. I&#8217;m really hoping nothing goes wrong at work while I&#8217;m away. I can work remotely no problem, but I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ll have internet access for the entire week I&#8217;m gone. Luckily we&#8217;ve got some pretty good contacts that are willing to help out in my absence. They&#8217;re all people who&#8217;ve proven very trustworthy over the past year.
