I&#8217;ve been really busy lately. I worked basically all weekend at the warehouse in Ankeny and at home. I think we&#8217;re making pretty good progress with the order verification system. I expect to have it up and running fully by Wednesday or Thursday. There&#8217;s a few issues with scanning certain UPC codes and an few issues that can easily be fixed by modifying our export order process.

I plan to implement these fixes tomorrow. I&#8217;ll probably have to go to Ankeny tomorrow to program the flatbed scanner a little differently. Doing so should fix the issues with scanning those few UPCs. [PSC&#8217;s][1] help forum has been a great help.

As you can probably imagine, I didn&#8217;t get a chance to upgrade this machine to Slackware 10.1 this weekend. Hopefully I can do it next weekend. I&#8217;ll have a new graphics card for it by then. I ordered an [MSI Geforce FX5200U-TD128][2]. Direct Rendering (DRI) hasn&#8217;t been working in the new Xorg with my Radeon 7200. The shitty frame rates are no longer tolerable. I&#8217;ve been using the gateway PC I got from work more than my main PC due to it&#8217;s crap video performance. I did a lot of research before buying a card, and this one works very well with [Slackware][3] and [Dropline Gnome][4]. Mostly due to the great driver provided by Nvidia. I&#8217;m very excited to recieve it.
