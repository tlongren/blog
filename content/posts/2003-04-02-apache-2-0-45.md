Apache 2.0.45 has been released. From the apache httpd website:

> This version of Apache is principally a security and bug fix release. A summary of the bug fixes is given at the end of this document. Of particular note is that 2.0.45 addresses two security vulnerabilities, both affecting all platforms.
> 
> Prior Apache 2.0 versions through 2.0.44 had a significant Denial of Service vulnerability that was identified and reported by David Endler <DEndler@iDefense.com>, and fixed with this release. The specific details of this issue will be published by David Endler one week from this release, on April 8th [this is the correct, revised date]. No more specific information is disclosed at this time, but all Apache 2.0 users are encouraged to upgrade now.

> 
> This release eliminated leaks of several file descriptors to child processes, such as CGI scripts, which could consitute a security threat on servers that run untrusted CGI scripts. This issue was identified, reported and addressed by Christian Kratzer <ck@cksoft.de> and Bjoern A. Zeeb <bz@zabbadoz.net>.
