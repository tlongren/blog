## Flatland-Alt, Renamed and Improved {.subtitle}

Flatland-Alt creator, [Jamie Wilson][1], informed that he [released a new SublimeText theme, Predawn][2].  
https://twitter.com/jmwlsn/status/441007296181567488

Predawn is actually a new and improved, renamed version of Flatland-Alt, but still sticks with the dark interface. Here&#8217;s how Predawn describes itself in it&#8217;s GitHub repo.

> Predawn is a minimal Sublime Text theme and a syntax color scheme. It was originally just a slightly tweaked version (called Flatland-Alt) of the [Flatland][3] theme, which itself is a flat reworking of [Soda][4]. I decided to keep going with cusomization and rework the entire theme. But I owe a lot to Flatland and Soda. Thanks guys!

Predawn can be installed via Package Control and activating the theme is pretty standard:

<pre class="lang:default decode:true " >{
"theme": "predawn.sublime-theme",
"color_scheme": "Packages/Predawn/predawn.tmTheme"
}</pre>

There&#8217;s some other options regarding the sidebar size that you can set as well. It even includes some really nice looking dock icons for SublimeText.

Jamie also included his favorite SublimeText configuration, there&#8217;s definitely some things he&#8217;s using that I should be.

Give [Predawn][2] a try. If you&#8217;re a fan of Flatland or Flatland-Alt, you&#8217;ll love [Predawn][2].
