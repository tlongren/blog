The &#8220;[Towel Trick][1]&#8221; is an interesting solution to the 3 red lights on the ring of light (ROL). Supposedly, a user experiencing the 3 red lights on the ROL completely wrapped his Xbox 360 in a towel, with the red lights on, and let the Xbox 360 sit for about 10 minutes. He then turned his system off, then on again, and his Xbox 360 booted without issue. He was able to play for about 3 hours before the 3 red lights came back.  
<!--adsense-->

  
Sounds like an unlikely fix, but who knows? Well, I know, because I tested lastnight. The &#8220;Towel Trick&#8221; is bunk, total crap. You&#8217;re more likely to set your Xbox 360 on fire by doing this rather than fixing it. The best advice still is to contact [Microsoft support][2]. You can call them toll-free at 1-800-4MY-XBOX. They have an excellent support department lined up there for the Xbox/Xbox 360.

**UPDATE:** Here&#8217;s a [video of the Towel Trick][3] on YouTube.

**UPDATE 7/14/2011:** [Rob][4] left some good points [in his comment below][4]. A number of people in the comments on this post have suggested putting your Xbox 360 in a microwave to fix the 3 red lights issue. I would advise against this for a number of reasons.

Rob presented a number of things users should consider prior to microwaving any electronic device:

  1. 95% of all hardware failures are caused by very slight board  
    warpage right under the G.P.U. where heat build up  
    occurs . this will literally cause the Chips connections to pull  
    away form the board.
  2. A standered refolw @ 255c will almost always get your console  
    working.
  3. Specific Microwaves frequency acts on water molecules causing  
    them to resonate ( absorb the energy) and then release it as heat
  4. you have a better chance of repairing using a heat gun or  
    removing the xclamp and replacing it with screws and then  
    force the G.P.U. only to over heat ( standered x clamp mod )
  5. Microwaves will cause metal objects to build up charges  
    normally at or on sharp edges until it discharges causing sparks  
    kina cool looking , try a Christmas ornaments.
  6. If you decide to stick you game console in your mw oven the ods are not in your  
    favor and after the attempt fails your chances of a correct repair  
    procedure are lost.
  7. Just use some common sense and realize if this had a high successes rate  
    every one would be doing it . in fact people would be modified  
    micro wave oven for that purpose only and they would be fixing consoles  
    In volumes.
