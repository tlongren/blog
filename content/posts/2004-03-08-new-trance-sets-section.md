I added a new item to the nav menu at the top of the page. It&#8217;s called &#8220;Trance Sets&#8221;. That page displays DJ Pi and DJ Doboy sets that I have obtained. If you are looking for any of these mixes, send me an e-mail and I might be willing to upload a few to you.

DJ Pi stuff is quite hard to find on the internet, hopefully this will make it a bit easier for some people.
