Google is finally indexing the longren.org domain. I think it took right about 6 months for longren.org to start showing up in regular Google search results. Now maybe I&#8217;ll get more referrals from people searching google rather than just people searching google blogsearch.

The longren.org domain has a [pagerank of 5][1]. When I was at my old URL I had a PR of 3 I believe.

I had a lot more to do this weekend than I originally thought. After we got back from Cedar Rapids on Saturday, I came into work for about 3 hours. Then Ashley and I went to see The Nadas at Peoples Bar in Ames. Amber, Ashleys sister wanted to take her to that as a little birthday gift. Katie, one of their friends ended up getting an OWI, went to jail and doesn&#8217;t have a license anymore. I kinda felt bad, but not really.

And most of yesterday was spent playing Tiger Woods 2006. It&#8217;s wicked fun, my favorite one of em all so far. JV bought it Friday and brought it over yesterday. Now that I think about it, he may have forgotten it in my Xbox, so I may have something to look forward to when I get home this evening.
