HTML5Press 2.4 is available for download. Since it&#8217;s not in the WordPress theme directory, you [can grab it here][1]. It&#8217;s been over a year since I made the last release. Jesper has made some pretty noticeable changes to [the design][2] this theme is based on in that year+, and [released version 2.1 on August 1, 2012][3]. I&#8217;m just now getting around to updating HTML5Press.

The biggest changes in HTML5Press 2.4 is the overall design. You can see what the old version looked like on the [HTML5Press page][1]. There&#8217;s screenshots in a gallery at the bottom, all of those screenshots are of older versions based on the original design. A screenshot of version 2.4 is included with this post.

I&#8217;ve also added a shortcode for embedding the featured post slider on an individual post or page. Just enter the following shortcode into your post or page and the featured post slider will be attached to that page. It will pull posts from the category selected on the HTML5Press settings page. Here&#8217;s the shortcode:

<pre>[featured]</pre>

If you have any problems or find any bugs, please leave a comment here or on the [HTML5Press page][1], or, you could also [submit a new issue on Github][4]. I would encourage you to submit a new issue on Github if you do find a bug. I really dislike having open issues for HTML5Press, so issues/bugs reported on Github will generally be fixed much quicker than bugs reported here.
