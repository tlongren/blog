I decided to check my Mediacom e-mail account this morning and it had this lone e-mail sitting in the Inbox. I guess Mediacom is doubling the speeds for my area&#8230;and many others as it turns out. I currently have a 1.5 megabits downstream and 128 kilobits upstream. After the upgrade, I&#8217;ll have a 3 megabits per sond downstream and a 256 kilobits per second upstream.

It&#8217;s supposed to happen Feb. 1&#8230;.here in a few days! Anyway, here&#8217;s the e-mail:
