[Ryan Boren][1] posted about [MySQL requirements][2] in the upcoming WordPress 2.1 release. WordPress 2.1 will require MySQL 4.0, MySQL 4.1 won&#8217;t be required until WordPress 2.2 comes around. So, WordPress 2.1 will require at least MySQL 4.0 to function correctly. No more MySQL 3 people. If you&#8217;re still using MySQL 3, it&#8217;s far past time to upgrade.

[MySQL AB discontinued support][3] for MySQL 4.0 back in September, so it&#8217;s likely hosting companies will be upgrading to 4.1 within a year or so.

Also, WordPress 2.1 beta 3 is out, it&#8217;s running on this blog right now.
