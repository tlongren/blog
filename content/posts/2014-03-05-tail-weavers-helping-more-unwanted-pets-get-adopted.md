One set of my parents, Roger and Carol, are [starting a nonprofit to help unwanted pets find new homes][1]. It&#8217;s a very personal thing for them, and me as well. 

It&#8217;s sickening that animals have to lose their lives because there&#8217;s no room for them in their local animal shelter.

Tail Weavers is trying to change that by making it easier for unwanted pets to find new homes. Here&#8217;s a bit from [tailweavers.com][1]:

> We are [in the process of becoming] a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization with the vision of a nation where kill shelters are extinct. Raising the funds and getting our legal nonprofit status is Phase 1.
> 
> Our mission is to provide free hybrid photography training to photographers and to have them donate their new skill to shelters and rescues. The still portraits and Tails In Motion portraits (the hybrid part &#8211; a little move that combines stills and video and audio) will be posted by the shelter/rescue to promote the quick adoption of the pet into a permanent home.

There is [a $2200 goal setup on GoFundMe][2], that funding will be used to actually setup the 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. You can donate by visiting [the crowdfunding page][2], which also contains for more info.

If you&#8217;d like the help, the best way you can do so right now is by [donating to setup the 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization][2].
