Should Bush and Blair [Consider Bombing Al Jazeera][1]? Why not, they obviously all reside in the same area/building 24/7/365. Stupid. Daniel Johnson does [make a good point][1] in the end:

> Actually, we have no right to know the contents of secret conversations between presidents and prime ministers. Now that this particular cat is out of the bag, it may make sense for British authorities to put the record straight. But, in general, no government is obliged to reveal anything at all about operational decisions in wartime.
> 
> Wartime? Aye, there&#8217;s the rub. Most Americans believe they are fighting a war against terror. Most Europeans don&#8217;t. Most Americans are determined to win this war. Most Europeans have already given up.

[Power Line][2] has more.
