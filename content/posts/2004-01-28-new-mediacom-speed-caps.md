It seems that Mediacom decided to speed things up a little. Early this morning I was able to download around 350kb/sec. Uploads now go at a steady 30kb/sec instead of the usual 14kb/sec. It&#8217;s so awesome I didn&#8217;t have to wait another 3 days for the upgrade!

I haven&#8217;t noticed any troubles with the upgrade yet. Hopefully everything during the upgrade goes smoothly, I don&#8217;t want them to take this away for ANY reason!
