## Zombie Image Placeholders Are Back {.subtitle}

And just in time for Halloween!

I wrote a post about my [10 favorite image placeholder services][1] a while ago. Placezombies.com was one of them. Here&#8217;s the [announcement blog post][2] for Placezombies.com.

Down in the comments, you&#8217;ll see that the owners forgot to renew the domain name, so it obviously stopped working. The source was [posted on GitHub][3], so I immediately [forked it][4] and got to work setting up a replacement.

A quick check revealed that [placezombie.com][5] was available, so I registered it. Score.

I really didn&#8217;t want to host this at [DigitalOcean][6] like I typically would, not knowing what to expect for bandwidth usage. Instead, I chose to host it at [Heroku][7], using their free service.

Had a few issues getting it running, but after removing some Ruby stuff and creating the Procfile and package.json files that Heroku requires, I was almost good to go. Only thing holding me back was to [replace the port number node.js was using with the port that Heroku uses][8]. Did another `git push heroku master`, navigated to <http://placezombie.com> and there it was!

Here&#8217;s a 700&#215;300 zombie below for proof!

![Placezombie.com][9] 

That was generated like so:

<pre class="lang:xhtml decode:true " >&lt;img src="http://placezombie.com/700x300" alt="Placezombie.com" /&gt;</pre>

You can do black and white images, too:  
![Placezombie.com][10] 

That was generated like so:

<pre class="lang:xhtml decode:true " >&lt;img src="http://placezombie.com/g/700x300" alt="Placezombie.com" /&gt;</pre>

So, [add some gore to your mock-ups][11], just make sure your clients aren&#8217;t too squeamish.

My 5 year old daughter is obsessed with Zombies and is going to fucking love this. She wants to be a Zombie Elsa (from the movie Frozen) for Halloween. `:)`
