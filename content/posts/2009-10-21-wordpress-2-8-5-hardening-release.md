[WordPress 2.8.5][1] has been released. This is another security release, just like the [2.8.4 release][2]. As with the last release, the [SANS Internet Storm Center][3] has [another post][4] about the latest WordPress.  
[ad]  
The WordPress team decided to call 2.8.5 a hardening release because it includes some security features that were back-ported to 2.8.x from the upcoming 2.9 series. Below are some details about [2.8.5][1] from the [WordPress development blog][5]:

> As you know over the past couple of months we have been working on the new features for WordPress 2.9. We have also been working on trying to make WordPress as secure as possible and during this process we have identified a number of security hardening changes that we thought were worth back-porting to the 2.8 branch so as to get these improvements out there and make all your sites as secure as possible.
> 
> The headline changes in this release are:
> 
>   * A fix for the Trackback Denial-of-Service attack that is currently being seen.
>   * Removal of areas within the code where php code in variables was evaluated.
>   * Switched the file upload functionality to be whitelisted for all users including Admins.
>   * Retiring of the two importers of Tag data from old plugins.
