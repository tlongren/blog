Yesterday, a federal judge in California ruled that it&#8217;s unconstitutional to recite the pledge of allegiance in public schools. All this started a couple years ago when Michael Newdow started throwing a fit that his daughter had to hear the words &#8220;under god&#8221; in the pledge while at school.

I&#8217;m a self proclaimed atheist, so this really doesn&#8217;t matter much to me. I just don&#8217;t care. When you recite the pledge of allegiance, you&#8217;re not pledging your allegiance to &#8220;god&#8221;, you&#8217;re pledging your allegiance to the United States. This has really pissed me off cuz I had to say the pledge every damn day in school.

In my opinion, the judge was wrong. He didn&#8217;t have to rule that the pledge is unconstitutional in a public school setting. Can&#8217;t the kids that don&#8217;t want to hear it just leave the room for about 5 seconds? I&#8217;m not religious at all, I still wouldn&#8217;t leave the room just because I know the meaning of the pledge. I hope Michael Newdow gets skull fucked. That fuck is forcing his opinions on others more than anyone ever has done to his daughter. Suck my nuts Dr. Newdow.

That&#8217;s how I feel, there&#8217;s a lotta people that feel much more strongly than I do. Some others people covering: [Danny Carlton][1], [Part-Time Pundit][2], [L.T.
