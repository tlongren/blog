[WordPress 2.5][1] was released on March 29th. The current version of [Unwakeable][2] (version 1.2.1) doesn&#8217;t play so well with WordPress 2.5. The only thing that&#8217;s really broken is the dashboard, which is a pretty big thing to have broken.  
<!--adsense-->

  
It seems there&#8217;s a known issue with K2 themes and the WordPress 2.5 dashboard, as explained in the [K2 support forums][3]. There&#8217;s supposedly [a fix][4] for this issue, but I could not get it to work fully. The fix works fine as long as you have K2 sidebar modules disabled from the theme options page.  
<!--adsense-->

  
Unwakeable 1.2.1 is so far broken and outdated I&#8217;m not even going to make an attempt at fixing it for WordPress 2.5. Instead, I&#8217;m working on Unwakeable 1.5, which is based off K2 Release Candidate 5. Unwakeable 1.5 is almost finished and should be up for download within a week, if not sooner.
