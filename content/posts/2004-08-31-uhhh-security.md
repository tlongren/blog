Just watchin the news. They had this totally media-brainwashed woman on there talking about what she wants to hear the presidential candidates speak of.

Here&#8217;s my imitation&#8230;..

&#8220;National security&#8230;ummm, foreign security&#8230;uhhh, social security&#8230;and, umm..&#8221;

That was about it. I can&#8217;t believe they put such a stupid fuck on T.V. What the hell could that add to anything? I wish I wouldn&#8217;t have watched those couple seconds, I feel like I&#8217;ve been robbed. All she could think about was security. I could tell she&#8217;s one of the people that sat on the couch and watched CNN and Fox News for 9 months after 9/11/01&#8230;pathetic and sick.
