My cousin Jerrad called me yesterday. He wanted to know if Ashley and I wanted to accompany him and Andrea to the Snoop Dogg concert in Des Moines on 4/20. As you can imagine, I gladly accepted. Tickets are $48 a piece. Jerrad bought two extras when he got his. JV was gonna try to get us some but they were sold out by the time he got around to it. Jerrad must have had these tickets for a little while.

It should be a good time. The show is at the [Val Air Ballroom][1]. Snoop Dogg is going to be there with The Game. I&#8217;ve been to a few shows at theVal Air before, I think both times before it was to see the Deftones.

Anyway, I&#8217;m very excited to go. I hope I don&#8217;t have to stay late at work for any reason this Wednesday, cuz I wanna go down to Jerrads right after work.
