## Fix display of portfolio grid rows {.subtitle}

Back in September of 2014 I wrote about using the [StanleyWP WordPress theme][1] for a portfolio site. After I added some projects, I noticed the grid on the Portfolio page template wasn&#8217;t displaying rows correctly. I even noted it in my [original post][2], towards the end.

I&#8217;ve had a few people contact me about how to fix the StanleyWP portfolio grid issue, and earlier today [Arun left a comment][3] asking how to fix the grid issue.

You need to be using a child theme for this, it&#8217;s just good practice. If you don&#8217;t know how to create a child theme, [read my post on creating a child theme][4]. It&#8217;s really easy to do, but may require you to reset your menu or some widgets after changing to the child theme.

Anyway, [Arun confirmed][5] that [this gist][6] fixed the problem for him.  


Just save that code as `template-portfolio.php` and put it in your child theme directory. Your portfolio should now show three projects per row. No CSS or anything else needs to be modified, just that one page template.

Let me know if you have any issues or questions.

					data-ulike-nonce="c5dddebc78"
					data-ulike-type="likeThis"
					data-ulike-template="wpulike-default"
