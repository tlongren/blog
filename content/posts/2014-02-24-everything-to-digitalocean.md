## Moving _everything_, and saving money while doing so {.subtitle}

In May of 2013 I move a bunch of websites from [Dreamhost][1] (it&#8217;s a referral link) over to [FlipHost][2]. Since discovering [DigitalOcean][3] (it&#8217;s a referral reward link), I&#8217;ve been slowly moving most of my hosting over to them.

I wasn&#8217;t at all uphappy with the service provided by FlipHost. In fact, their support was excellent and I had come to know the owner quite well. They&#8217;re all really great people. However, [PuPHPet and DigitalOcean][4] are impossible for me to resist any longer.

The ability to spin up droplets at will is amazing and [the API][5] makes building simple, custom control panels very simple. Even though their dash board is already pretty visually appealing.

I do still have a few sites for friends and family hosted at [Dreamhost][1] (also a referral reward link), but I&#8217;ll be moving them over to small DigitalOcean droplets within the coming weeks. One VPS at FlipHost has been canceled already and the other has been shutdown for the past 24 hours now, so I&#8217;ll be canceling it soon too.

Everything else has been moved to DigitalOcean for some time, including longren.org. The same droplet also servers [kegplan.io][7], but it&#8217;ll be getting it&#8217;s own droplet very shortly. And then I have a droplet that&#8217;s sole purpose is to [act as a tor node][8].

By moving everything to [DigitalOcean][3], I&#8217;ll be **saving about $30 a month on hosting**. I&#8217;m currently spending about $60 to $70 a month on hosting.

In addition to the great service provided by DigitalOcean, they have a pretty neat mascot, he looks good on t-shirts, too.

[DigitalOcean][3] has been great so far, especially their customer service and general availability. I love their [one-click application installs][10], too, which makes installing software like WordPress super simple. I have yet to have any issues with DigitalOcean

[DigitalOcean][3] droplets start at only $5/month. If you&#8217;d like to try it out, you can signup using my referral link, <https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=cbf49d0481c8>, which will give me account credit. You should also keep an eye on the [DigitalOcean Twitter account][11], as they frequently give discount codes that can get you a couple months of free hosting.

If you&#8217;re in the market for a new webhost, definitely [give DigitalOcean a shot][3]. Beware though, as with nearly everything, there&#8217;s negatives as well. [Raam Dev][12] posted [a comment warning about how a DigitalOcean site was taken down][13] due to a post on the site that was critical of a friend of the DigitalOcean CEO. There&#8217;s [plenty][14] of [other][15] [not-so-good][16] [experiences][17] with DigitalOcean, too. Luckily, my ride with [DigitalOcean][3] has been totally smooth.
