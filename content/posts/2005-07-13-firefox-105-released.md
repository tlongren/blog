OK, well I had to write about this quick too. Firefox 1.0.5 has been released. I just downloaded it at work. I&#8217;ll be installing it on everyone&#8217;s PC&#8217;s soon. I&#8217;ve been using the [Deer Park Alpha 2][1] for a while now. It&#8217;s way more unstable for me than Deer Park Alpha 1.

[Blogs for Firefox][2] has [news of the release][3]. They&#8217;ve got a bunch of details on the reasons for the 1.0.5 release. You can download the [latest version here][4].
