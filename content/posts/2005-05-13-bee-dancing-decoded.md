This is wicked interesting. [Blogs of War][1] pointed the way to [this Wired article][2].

> After finding food, scout bees returning to the hive dance on the vertical walls of the honeycomb. A round dance indicates the food is very close, within 35 yards or less. A figure-eight pattern indicates that the food is farther away. The bee indicates the distance to the food by how long it dances; it indicates the foodâ€™s richness by how vigorously it dances; and it indicates the foodâ€™s direction by the angle the dance deviates from an imaginary line drawn from the current position of the sun to the dance floor. The code is [complex and detailed][3].

They indicate foods direction by the angle the dance deviates from an imaginary line drawn from the current position of the sun. That&#8217;s totally crazy. I wish humans had the ability to do things like that. I&#8217;m sure we had the ability at one time, but has been lost throughout the ages. It&#8217;s too bad most people only use a small percentage of their brain. I want to train mine to work at at least 25% capacity. I&#8217;m gonna get started on that soon. Can anyone recommend any excercises I could do to help me achieve this?
