This can&#8217;t be a good idea. Won&#8217;t this just provide a better means for war-mongering, rich jack-asses to make money off death? Seems odd to me that the DoD was involved with this at it&#8217;s inception. This will allow traders to buy and sell contracts on assinations, terrorist attacks, and regime overthrows. 

For some reason, this reminds me of something I heard lastnight on TV. I was watching the 10:00 news and there was a story about some robbers or something. The news-anchor noted that law enforcement _managed_ to kill one of the suspects. Doesn&#8217;t that just sound like the cops going for blood? I hope the cops leave me alone. At this point in time, I probably won&#8217;t tolerate any harassment from the cops very well.
