One of the main reasons for moving this site to DreamHost was the increasing instability I was experiencing with my server, nightengale. The machine would lock up pretty randomly, with no warning. I&#8217;d have to yank the power cord from the back to get it to come back to life.

I noticed the power supply was quite a bit warmer than it should have been. The fan wasn&#8217;t spinning at all. The fan was only supposed to spin when it was needed, I never saw it spin. I tore that old PSU apart and the fan was extremely hard to move, and I was using my hand.

After the machine sat dormant for a few days, I decided to hit up Staples and see what they had for power supplies. Luckily they had the one I was wanting, the [Antec SP-350][1].

This new power supply is much quieter than the old one. It&#8217;s also a whole hell of a lot cooler to the touch. I&#8217;ve also compiled a few kernels with this new PSU and I can&#8217;t get the box to freeze. The freezing would usually occur when I was compiling a new kernel or something very CPU intensive for a period of time.
