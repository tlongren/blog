A bit late, but hey, that&#8217;s OK! Saw this in a [Yahoo! News piece][1] on [Clarity & Resolve][2] earlier today. I been readin a lot of stuff there lately. The guy&#8217;s got good thoughts&#8230;mostly. Anyway, this is all over the major news outlets by now.

> ISLAMABAD (Reuters) â€” Pakistani security forces, with help from U.S. intelligence, have arrested al Qaeda&#8217;s third most senior leader after Osama bin Laden and Ayman al Zawahri, Western intelligence sources said.
> 
> Pakistan says Abu Faraj Farj al Liby was the ringleader behind at least two assassination attempts against President Pervez Musharraf in December 2003. &#8230;
> 
> A U.S. counter-terrorism official in Washington was even more specific: &#8220;He is the third most important after bin Laden and Zawahri. It&#8217;s a significant blow to the group.&#8221;
> 
> &#8220;After KSM (Khalid Sheikh Mohammed) disappeared from the scene, Faraj took on some of his leadership responsibilities and was instrumental in directing al Qaeda operations globally, including attacks against the homeland.&#8221; 

This guy is supposedly the third in command. I&#8217;d be scared shitless if I was #2 or #1.
