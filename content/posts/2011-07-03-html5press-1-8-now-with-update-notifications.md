[HTML5Press 1.8][1] is now available for download. 1.8 includes more changes than any version to date, with the exception of the update to Jesper&#8217;s new [HTML5 template][2].

One of the larger changes in 1.8 is the addition of update notifications. This was implemented to help HTMl5Press users stay abreast of updates. I&#8217;ve seen a lot of sites running very old HTML5Press versions so hopefully this will help. It works by checking an XML file hosted here at longren.org for the current version of HTML5Press. If the version in the XML file is newer than the version you&#8217;re running, a notification will show in the WordPress dashboard letting you know of the update.

Other changes:

  * Add orange, black, and new blue color schemes.
  * German translation courtesy of Nick.
  * Updated tag image to a dark gray variant.
  * Fixes to 404
  * Fixes to performance when viewing in Firefox
  * Update to [modernizr 2.0.6][3].
  * Add option to show query stats in the footer.

That&#8217;s just a short list of some of the more notable changes. A lot of the changes between 1.7 and 1.8 were pretty boring, like wrapping post navigation links in the nav HTML5 tag and removing unnecessary spaces.  
[ad]  
The Firefox speed issues were being caused by the gradient background on the body element. Jesper [came up with a workaround][4] that he implemented in his HTML5 template, and I included in HTML5Press.

You can find a detailed [list of changes at Github][5]. HTML5Press 1.8 can be [downloaded from the HTML5Press page][1]. Issues [can be reported at Github][6] or in the comments on this post!
