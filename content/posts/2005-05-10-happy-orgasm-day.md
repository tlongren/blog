Saw this at [The Jawa Report][1] and it REALLY made me laugh! Those Brazilians are some of the most sexually adventurous people I know of. I can&#8217;t imagine they really need to make an &#8220;Orgasm Day&#8221;&#8230;

> Espertantina Mayor Felipe Santolia endorsed the May 9 holiday, which he said was intended to improve relationships between married couples.
> 
> &#8220;We&#8217;re celebrating orgasm in all its senses. There&#8217;s even a panel discussion on premature ejaculation. But from what I&#8217;ve seen, women have more trouble achieving orgasm than men, especially in marriage,&#8221; Santolia said by telephone from Esperantina, 1,300 miles north of Rio de Janeiro.
> 
> Santolia said the remote town of 38,000 people has been unofficially celebrating orgasm day for years, but that the town&#8217;s former mayor had vetoed a bill making it an official municipal holiday.
> 
> The city council passed a law Saturday creating the holiday. Santolia, who took office earlier this year, said he would sign the bill later Monday.
> 
> &#8220;I&#8217;m 32, single and I have an open mind. Beside the theme is very much of the moment,&#8221; he said.
> 
> Orgasm Day celebrations include a series of panel discussions by sexologists from across Brazil and a presentation of Eve Ensler&#8217;s play &#8220;The Vagina Monologues.&#8221;
> 
> Santolia said the idea of celebrating Orgasm Day at first created a scandal in this poor region, known for its religious fervor. But he said residents gradually residents warmed to the idea.

So, everyone have a happy Orgasm Day! Best of luck to you all! [Read the full Orgasm Day story][2].
