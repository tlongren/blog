Dr. Dave, the dude behind [Spam Karma][1], has [issued a warning to all WordPress users][2]. A message popped up on my Spam Karma 2 dashboard warning of a potential security vulnerability in [WordPress][3]. Here&#8217;s part of the warning:

> If you are running WordPress as your blogging platform and if you have been trusting enough to leave User registration enabled for guests, DISABLE IT IMMEDIATELY (in wp-admin >> options: make sure “Anyone can register” is not checked).
> 
> Additionally, delete or disable ANY guest account already created by people you are not sure about.
> 
> Leaving it open and letting people sign-up for guest accounts on your WordPress blog could lead to incredibly nasty stuff happening if anybody so desired. And trust me I am not exaggerating this. So don’t wait a second to disable this option and please relay the message.

Now, the WordPress development team was apparently notified a &#8220;while back&#8221;. They supposedly haven&#8217;t done anything yet to rectify this problem. Dr. Dave has received a lot of questions due to his initial post. In turn, [he&#8217;s made another post][4] in which he addresses some of those questions.

Hopefully we&#8217;ll see WordPress 2.0.4 out within a few days.

**UPDATE:** [WordPress 2.0.4 Beta is out][5]. It should be safe to open user registrations under WordPress 2.0.4. I&#8217;d expect to see the final 2.0.4 release next week.
