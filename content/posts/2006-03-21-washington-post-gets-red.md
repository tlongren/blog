The ever-liberal Washington Post is [starting up a new blog][1]. The blog is named [Red America][2] and is being run by Ben Domenech, co-founder of [RedState][3].

The launch of this new blog has apparently [upset some liberals][4]. Not sure why, I thought these types were all about &#8220;letting people choose&#8221; and providing un-biased information. I guess that only applies to media outlets they deem to be &#8220;conservative&#8221;.

[NewsBusters][5] has a nice post concerning the liberal whining. Others blogging on this topic include [Protein Wisdom][6], [Donklephant][7], [Decicion &#8217;08][8], and [Wizbang][9].

I, for one, welcome our new WaPo blog overlords. Oh, and if you want some more info about Ben and his work, check out [the first post][10] on Red America.  
**  
UPDATE 7:10PM CST:** I found this post at [MyDD][11] to be very amusing. Apparently the right-wing blogosphere has been destroyed.

> Glenn Reynolds is a columnist for MSNBC. Andrew Sullivan is a columnist for Time. Michelle Malkin is a frequently published columnist in a number of offline outlets. And now, RedState co-founder Ben Domenech has a regular column in the Washington Post.

I might be wrong, but doesn&#8217;t that help show how successful the conservative blogosphere has been? I&#8217;m pretty sure it does&#8230;crazy hippies. Now, I&#8217;m a member of the &#8220;conservative blogosphere&#8221;, and I&#8217;ve seen nothing but growth since my arrival. I&#8217;m not a big enough creature to matter though, so I guess it sucks to be me? I dunno, dun care.
