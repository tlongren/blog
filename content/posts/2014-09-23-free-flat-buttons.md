## Include stylesheet, apply class, done. {.subtitle}

I like flat design. I also like [Free Flat Buttons][1], from [freeflatbuttons.com][2]. Did I mention they&#8217;re free? But most buttons are free, so the naming must be a marketing thing.

It&#8217;s been a while since Free Flat Buttons have seen any updates, but there&#8217;s really nothing to update in my opinion. They serve their purpose quite well. They look very nice when paired with FontAwesome, too.

Free Flat Buttons can be [found on GitHub][3], it&#8217;s repository is very simple and only includes the button stylesheet and the HTML and CSS associated with the freeflatbuttons.com website.

They&#8217;re really simple to use, as they should be. All you have to do is include the CSS, <span class="lang:xhtml decode:true  crayon-inline " ><link rel=&#8221;stylesheet&#8221; href=&#8221;button.css&#8221;></span>, include the FontAwesome CSS if you want it, <span class="lang:xhtml decode:true  crayon-inline " ><link href=&#8221;http://netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.1.0/css/font-awesome.min.css&#8221; rel=&#8221;stylesheet&#8221;></span>, and then add a class to an anchor tag.

For a normal sized button, something like this:

<pre class="lang:xhtml decode:true " >&lt;a class="btn color-1" href="#"&gt;Color 1&lt;/a&gt;</pre>

To make a button with rounded corners, use style-2, the other styles are listed on the freeflatbuttons.com site:

<pre class="lang:xhtml decode:true " >&lt;a class="btn color-1 style-2" href="#"&gt;Color 1&lt;/a&gt;</pre>

Aside from the homepage, a demo can also be [found on CodePen][4]. I&#8217;ve embedded it below. Version 1.0 of Free Flat Buttons can be downloaded from <http://www.flatbuttons.com/button.css>.
