A [USA Today][1] article via [Blogs of War][2]:

> Pfc. Lynndie England, the Army reservist shown in some of the most notorious photos in the Abu Ghraib prison scandal, will plead guilty to abusing Iraqi detainees in a case that sparked global outrage against the United States and its military.
> 
> England, 22, faces a maximum sentence of 11 years in prison as part of the plea deal, which still must be accepted by a military judge, her attorney, Rick Hernandez, said Friday. She had been facing up to 16 years.
> 
> The plea deal came four days before England was scheduled to go on trial in a military court in Fort Hood. 

That&#8217;s almost funny, but sad really. What else can she do though?
