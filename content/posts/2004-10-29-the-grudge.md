This movie sucked bad. Please don&#8217;t waste your money on it. If you&#8217;re planning to see it, just give the money to a rabbit or somethin. It&#8217;ll be better used by the rabbit.

The noises the ghost/creature thing in the house made were so stupid. Everyone in the theater laughed everytime it made it&#8217;s little groaning noise. The movie abruptly came to an end&#8230;leaving me with an unfinished feeling.

Now, _SAW_ looks like a good horror flick. I think I might go see that one tonight. But _The Grudge_ was a total waste of time and money and everything else. I was pretty pissed off when I left the theater.

It was funnier than anythign else. Not &#8220;haha&#8221; funny, but stupid as fuck funny. A lot like Ashlee Simpson dancing around when her song changed on SNL.
