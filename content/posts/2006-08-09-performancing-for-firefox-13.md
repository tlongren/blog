I&#8217;m writing this post with this new version of Performancing. So far nothing unusual. The addons and themes API additions are sweet, hopefully some worthy developers will hack together some neat addons. I&#8217;m excited about this new version, it&#8217;s opened a lot more doors for Performancing.
