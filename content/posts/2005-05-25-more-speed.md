I went home for lunch and reset my cable modem. I downloaded the latest 2.6 linux kernel from [www.kernel.org][1] at about 580kb/sec. Upload is still the same unfortunately

So, it appears that as of right now, the speed upgrade for Mediacom is in effect in Ames/Nevada, Iowa. I am going to call Mediacom tonight about the 10/1 package to see if it&#8217;s available yet. Someone on the [BroadbandReports Mediacom forum][2] said it&#8217;s not ready yet. I&#8217;m gonna see for myself anyway.

Either way, 5Mbit down is nice to have. I&#8217;m looking for ISO&#8217;s to download right now. I&#8217;m gonna see what kinda speeds I get from carroll.cac.psu.edu. They have some slackware ISO images I think.

Below is a screenshot of the kernel download.
