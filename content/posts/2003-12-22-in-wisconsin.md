I came up to my dads house in Wisconsin tonight. I got here around 7:00 I think&#8230;I dun really remember. Not sure when I&#8217;ll be goin back to Chicago. I&#8217;d like to go back to Iowa for new years, I dunno if that will happen or not.

I&#8217;m using my step-mom&#8217;s (Carol) tablet PC with WinXP on it. It&#8217;s pretty neat. It&#8217;s nice being able to post this while watching King of the Hill on a 65&#8243; T.V.. The keyboard on this tablet PC is kinda small, but I guess thats the point. This is the first time I&#8217;ve gotten to use the wireless connection here at Dad&#8217;s since he set it up. Works pretty well. Dad and carol are opening a Coffee Gallery next month. You can view the beautiful website at [http://www.wanderlustcoffeegallery.com][1]. The name of the coffee shop/art gallery is Wanderlust Coffee Gallery. It sounds like they&#8217;ve got a pretty good location, so hopefully everything goes well.
