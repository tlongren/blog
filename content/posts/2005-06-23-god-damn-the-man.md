This is getting old. Subjecting people to rooms that aren&#8217;t air-conditioned isn&#8217;t torture. Letting one urinate on ones self isn&#8217;t torture. I pissed myself a lot when I was a baby. I didn&#8217;t have the ability to claim torture then, so maybe that&#8217;s why I never said anything about the horrendous torture I was subjected to as an infant.

The [U.N. has uncovered torture][1] at Gitmo. Did you know that? It&#8217;s really exciting, since it&#8217;s way off base. It seems the U.N. is condeming the US for non-cooperation in the Gitmo investigation, not what the AP would have you believe.

Rusty at [The Jawa Report][2] says he knows of no torture occuring at Gitmo. He makes a good point, as usual.

> As far as the alleged abuse that has come from declassified documents I know of no torture. What I do know of is harsh treatment that idiots on the Left have characterized as torture.

> -loud music

Yah, loud music is definately torture. Sorry, I&#8217;m feelin sarcastic today. If people were having their nipples twisted off, or unusually shaped objects rammed into their asses, I&#8217;d understand the claims of torture. Simply being uncomfortable isn&#8217;t torture. Fuck, I could claim I&#8217;m being tortured at work when our air conditioner dies.

God this shit is getting to be really amusing. Oh, it&#8217;s really cool to do evil things to the Koran these days. [Here&#8217;s some pics for you to enjoy][3]. It does look like fun, I might have to pick one up sometime and abuse the hell outta it.
