THere&#8217;s lots of good DJ&#8217;s out there today, but in my opinion, DJ Pi and DJ Doboy are a couple of the best. DJ Pi is less known than Doboy, but Pi&#8217;s mixes are of comparable quality to those of Doboy. Doboy also gets a lot more airtime on <a href=http://www.di.fm>Digitally Imported</a>. This probably has something to do with his popularity.

I&#8217;ve found myself being more and more drawn to DJ Pi&#8217;s stuff. His mixes aren&#8217;t readily avaible anywhere on the web, so he&#8217;s been uploading his newest mixes to me directly. I spoke with Pi today and he told me to expect Trance Empire Vol 6 (the next vol of Trance Empire) sometime around Feb 15. Trance Empire Vol 5 is my fav one right now. I&#8217;m really looking forward to Vol 6!
