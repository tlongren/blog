I released [Unwakeable 1.5][1] last night. This means Unwakeable is 100% compatible with WordPress 2.5! The previous version of Unwakeable, 1.2.1, didn&#8217;t [play so nicely][2] with WordPress 2.5.

Unwakeable 1.5 was built from the ground up using [K2 r687][3] as a starting point. I decided to start fresh for Unwakeable 1.5 and scrapped pretty much all the code from 1.2.1. Unwakeable still has all the features it had in previous versions.  
[ad]  
Advanced navigation and live search now work in Unwakeable. Unwakeable also comes with the K2 Sidebar Manager, a superior alternative to WordPress widets. You can enable the K2 Sidebar Manager or you can use WordPress widgets, either one will work. Or, if you don&#8217;t like sidebar managers, you can continue to modify the contents of sidebar.php to get the sidebar setup you desire.

You can [download Unwakeable 1.5][1] from the official Unwakeable page. Please let me know of any bugs or problems you run into.
