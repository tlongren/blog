A writer at Daily Kos has his panties in a bundle over nothing. Well, he may have a good reason for the ranting and raving, but he&#8217;s targetting the wrong &#8220;Stop the ACLU&#8221;. I am a member of the [Stop the ACLU Blogburst team][1], not a member of the [Stop the ACLU Coalition][2]. That kos kid seems to think the two are one in the same, although they are somewhat related. He should have looked more closely at the domains, one being a .org and the other being a .com. [Longren.com][3] obviously has nothing to do with [longren.org][4].

This all boils down to the .org website posting some personal information about two Jewish families that resulted in them not feeling safe, so they had to move. I&#8217;m not gonna go into the gory details, just head over to the [Stop the ACLU blog][5] for more details. [Right on the Right][6] has some interesting facts to point out also.
