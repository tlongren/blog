So, AOL released a bunch of search data. Doesn&#8217;t sound so bad right? Well, it is, because AOL included identities, so basically you can see who has been searching for what. The data spans over a 3 month period. It even gives information as to which links were clicked on the search results page. No usernames are included, but user ID&#8217;s are, which can be linked back to usernames with little trouble. From [Techcrunch][1]:

> The utter stupidity of this is staggering. AOL has released very private data about its users without their permission. While the AOL username has been changed to a random ID number, the abilitiy to analyze all searches by a single user will often lead people to easily determine who the user is, and what they are up to. The data includes personal names, addresses, social security numbers and everything else someone might type into a search box.

The original download has since been taken offline. However, [there&#8217;s plenty of mirrors][2]. The data in its compressed form weighs in around 439M, uncompressed it reaches just over 2 gigs.  
[  
UNEASYsilence has taken time][3] to look through some of the data. Some of what they saw actually frightened them.

> There are some truly scary things in this database.
> 
> There are hundreds of searches from people looking to kill themselves and even more scary are searches from users that seem to be looking to commit murder.

People are fucked up. Really though, some good could come of this. With all this super detailed search data, certain groups of people could be targeted. For example, those searching for &#8220;boylove&#8221; or &#8220;child love&#8221; constantly could be assumed to be some sort of pedophile. I could see groups like [The War Against Nambla][4] using this information to find new sickos to target.

**UPDATE:** AOL is now [saying this was a screw up][5]. Initially the data was reported to be released to the public for research purposes. [Jason Calacanis][6], an AOL employee, is [suggesting that AOL &#8220;NOT KEEP LOGS of our search data.&#8221;][7]
