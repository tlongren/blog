[Al-Qaida claimed responsibility][1] lastnight for the suicide attack on the three Hotels in Amman, Jordan. The statement was posted on a website that &#8220;acts as a clearing house for statements by militant groups.&#8221; Here&#8217;s a little excerpt from [the Al-Qaida statement][2].

> A group of lions &#8230; have launched a new attack against some dens that were planted in the Muslim land in Amman. After studying and watching the targets, some places were chosen and they were made by the tyrant of Jordan as a backyard garden for the enemies of the religion &#8211; Jews and crusaders &#8211; and a filthy place for the traitors of this nation and a safe haven for the infidels&#8217; Mukhabarat that run conspiracies against the Muslims and a center for prostitution.

Damn prostitution centers, the root of all evil in the world. Nevermind Al-Qaida&#8217;s prescense in the drug game around the world. Hypocrites. [More][3] can be read at the BBC. H/T [JihadWatch][4].
