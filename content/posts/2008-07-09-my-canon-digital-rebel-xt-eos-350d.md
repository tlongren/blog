I just got a new digital camera a couple weeks ago! It&#8217;s a [Canon Digital Rebel XT (EOS 350D)][1]. I&#8217;m still pretty excited, my new Canon is a major upgrade from my [old Olympus][2].  
[ad]  
My new Digital Rebel XT has been a pleasure to shoot with so far, but I still have a lot of things to learn, this is my first experience with [SLR cameras][3]. One thing I absolutely love about the camera is it&#8217;s ability to continuously shoot. It&#8217;s extremely nice for photographing [fast moving children][4] who never sit still. No more missed shots while waiting for my camera to focus.

The Digital Rebel XT is very easy to use. After receiving the camera, I immediately put the lens on, popped a cf card in, and was able to start shooting. Ashley was even able to pick it up and shoot without any instructions. I&#8217;ve been really happy with the camera so far and am very much looking forward to more opportunities to shoot with it, should be fun.
