I think I&#8217;m gonna go pick up a dvd burner this evening after work. Not sure yet as to what I&#8217;m gonna get. I just know I need one. I bought a 160Gb hard drive a few months ago, it&#8217;s about 90% full now. I wanna free up some space on it by burning some of the files to DVD&#8217;s.

I was thinking [this one from Wal-Mart][1] looks pretty good. It&#8217;s an HP 16x DVD+/- Double-Layer LightScribe Drive. Those LightScribe drives are pretty cool. They have the ability to etch labels directly onto the DVD. So no more crappy looking titles/labels made with sharpie markers.

Not quite sure what I&#8217;ll end up getting yet, but I&#8217;m definately gonna get something.
