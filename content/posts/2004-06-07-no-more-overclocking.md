My processors are no longer being overclocked. I&#8217;ve got em running at their normal 733mhz. The reason behind this is weird voltages coming from my motherboard. All the voltages are slightly lower than they should be, and I think this is the reason my computer has been acting up lately. I think the overclocking might have had something to do with it. I do need to get a new motherboard for this PC sometime. Actually, when I get a job, I&#8217;ll probably replace the motherboard, processors, and RAM.
