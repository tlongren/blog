Butler is doing very, very well in the NCAA tournament so far. They beat Louisville yesterday and Mississippi State the other night. In the brackets, I had Butler losing to Mississippi State, like quite a few other people did. I&#8217;ve never even heard of Butler&#8230;oh well. Michigan State is also doing much better than I thought they would. They controlled the entire game against Florida yesterday. Michigan State ended up winning by 22 points. Who would have thought?
