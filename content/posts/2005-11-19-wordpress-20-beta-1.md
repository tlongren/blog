I updated my local development [WordPress][1] branch last night via subversion to find the version had been bumped up to &#8220;2.0-beta-1&#8221;. So, this site is running beta wordpress code now. I had been running the latest subversion code until 1.5.2 was released. I decided I wasn&#8217;t gonna use code from the devel branch until it hit beta. So here we are.

I was waiting on 1.6, but 2.0 works too. I haven&#8217;t noticed any issues yet. All my plugins even seem to be working correctly. I really love the new and improved dashboard. And my current theme works as it did before with no problems. I definately [noticed beta1][2], as did a [couple][3] [other][4] bloggers, and probably a lot more. There&#8217;s a [discussion][5] about the beta going on at the [WordPress support forums][5]. There&#8217;s already some pretty large lists of compatible plugins. I&#8217;ll write more about this later, along with a few other related items. I&#8217;m goin to bed now.
