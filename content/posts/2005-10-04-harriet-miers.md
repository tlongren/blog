I woke up just in time to see Bush announcing his nomination for the next SCOTUS position yesterday morning. I was still pretty groggy so I didn&#8217;t really gather that much from it.

I haven&#8217;t really read much about her yet, she looks to be a pretty nice lady though. Lastnight, I was watching FoxNews for a little bit. Someone was bitching because Harriet Miers is a &#8220;total unknown&#8221;. &#8220;Total unknown&#8221; is a little extreme I think, considering that [googling her name][1] yielded 60,000+ results not long after Bush had made the announcement.

Just goes to show that Bush can&#8217;t please anyone, no matter what he does. Had he nominated Jesus H. Christ himself, people would have bitched, mostly the religious right probably. I&#8217;m not just talking about the left here, I&#8217;m talkin everyone that has their own little agendas that don&#8217;t help our country at all.

Miers was a former [lawyer for Microsoft][2]. She basically protected them from various class action lawsuits. Also, [she&#8217;s pro-life][3]. I can already tell I&#8217;m not gonna like this lady. She helped Microsoft retain their monopoly. She doesn&#8217;t think grown women are able to make their own decisions that affect their own bodies.

She may not take that stance publically, but that&#8217;s the impression I get from what she&#8217;s been found to do in the past. Maybe I&#8217;m totally off and she&#8217;s really just that [Rachel Dratch lady from SNL][4].

[Stephen Bainbridge][5] thinks she&#8217;s a B+ pick and the Supreme Court deserves an A+ pick. He couldn&#8217;t be more right. Sean at [The American Mind][6] thinks there&#8217;s just not enough known about her at this moment, kinda like the position we were in with Roberts.

And [the Political Teen][7] has an open trackback post.
