## Routing in PHP using AltoRouter

I&#8217;ve been using [AltoRouter][1] for help with building simple API&#8217;s. A full framework (even a micro-framework), like [Slim][2], is usually overkill for my needs, and often, any kind of routing class is overkill. A .htaccess file with the proper rewrite rules will usually suffice.

When I do need a bit more control than a .htaccess file provides, I usually go with AltoRouter. AltoRouter is really easy to use.

First thing to do when using AltoRouter, or pretty much any PHP routing class/script, is to direct all requests to index.php. We do this with a .htaccess file. Here&#8217;s the .htaccess file I usually use with a project using AltoRouter:<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-embed-handler">

<div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
  <div class="oembed-gist">
    <noscript>
      View the code on <a href="https://gist.github.com/tlongren/9038802">Gist</a>.
    </noscript>
  </div>
</div></figure> 

That will direct all requests to your site to index.php. Inside index.php is where we setup AltoRouter, define our routing rules, and specify any parameters that we want to capture. A basic example of an index.php file using AltoRouter can be seen below.  
<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-embed-handler">

<div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
  <div class="oembed-gist">
    <noscript>
      View the code on <a href="https://gist.github.com/tlongren/9038883">Gist</a>.
    </noscript>
  </div>
</div></figure> 

Lines 10-15 are just standard routes being setup, we could easily do this with a .htaccess file. The next block, with the &#8220;Special&#8221; comment title, is a little more involved. But only because we&#8217;re passing a parameter or two to our PHP controller.

When I say PHP controller, I&#8217;m referencing the third parameter in the AltoRouter map() method. The **first** parameter is the HTTP request method, usually either **GET** or **POST**. The **second** parameter is the route we want to watch for. The **third** parameter is the controller, or the PHP file that we want when the route from parameter two is matched. And the **fourth** parameter is just a unique name for that route.

If you&#8217;re using named parameters in your routes, like you see being done on **lines 18 and 19** in the **index.php gist**, you&#8217;re going to want to access them within your controller. Notice the very end of the index.php gist, specifically, everything below the _/\* Match the current request \*/_ comment. That&#8217;s where we&#8217;re doing the actual matching, if the current URL matches a defined route, then we require the controller.

Before that though, we&#8217;re actually setting the $match variable. Since we&#8217;re setting $match before including our controller, $match should be available for use within our controller, which is awesome!

Say we&#8217;re charging a customer, and this is done by hitting /charge/the\_customer\_id/, where **the\_customer\_id** is an actual customer ID. In our controller, charge.php, we can access **the\_customer\_id** named parameter as seen below. It&#8217;s available in `$match['params']['customer_id']`.<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-embed-handler">

<div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
  <div class="oembed-gist">
    <noscript>
      View the code on <a href="https://gist.github.com/tlongren/9039329">Gist</a>.
    </noscript>
  </div>
</div></figure> 

You can use all sorts of limits on your named parameters, like integer matching, alphanumeric matching, and even hexadecimal character matching. A useful list of named parameter limits and some examples can be seen in the [AltoRouter readme][1]. Comments are open, so please let me know if I&#8217;ve missed something or am just totally off base somewhere. Thanks!!
