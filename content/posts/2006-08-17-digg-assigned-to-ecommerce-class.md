[Par!x received an interesting comment][1] yesterday. Apparently, the commenter is taking an e-commerce class. An assignment for the class involves signing up at Digg and submitting articles/comments. This of course [intrigued Par!x so he sent the commenter an email][2] asking for some more details about this assignment. Here&#8217;s whats involved in the Assignment:

> ‚ÄúDigg activity. You‚Äôll need to create a Digg account and become an active member. As a minimum, you‚Äôll need to do the following by lesson 35:
> 
> 1. Submit at least three stories directly related to a topic from class. To count, articles cannot be ‚Äòdups‚Äô.
> 
> 2. Comment on at least ten articles. To count, a comment must say something intelligent and represent a complete thought.
> 
> Digg Grade. If you meet the above two actions, you will get a grade no lower than a C. For this assignment, I will give the highest grades to those with the most Diggs on their submitted stories as well as an evaluation of the quality of your submitted comments. I also encourage each student to ‚Äòdigg‚Äô other submitted articles by cadets in Mgt 392‚Äîbe generous by digging submitted articles from fellow students. On lesson M13, I will provide an initial, 50-point progress grade of your Digg activity. Final Digg activity is due M35. On lessons M13 and M35, please send me an email containing the URL to your Digg profile page.‚Äù

Those students with the highest amounts of diggs will receive the top grades. Sounds like it&#8217;d be an interesting class, but I&#8217;m not sure how this exactly relates to ecommerce. I&#8217;ve taken a few ecommerce classes and it&#8217;s the same basic stuff every time, B2B, B2C, etc. There&#8217;s really not much &#8220;ecommerce&#8221; involved with digg.

Par!x is gonna be doing a follow up post at some point, I&#8217;m patiently waiting for more info.

**UPDATE:** Par!x posted an update with [the students Digg identity][3]. Looks like she&#8217;s been pretty successful so far. I bet she gets one of the top grades in that class.
