This is just getting silly now. I say just quit now and forget anything ever happened. There will be no end, there will be no conclusion. There&#8217;ll always be someone [who&#8217;s not talking][1]. Bob Woodward says he knew of Valerie Plame a month before Libby supposedly leaked her identity. It&#8217;s kinda hard for Libby to be the source of the leak when others knew of it before he had a chance to &#8220;leak.&#8221;

> Bob Woodward apologized to The Washington Post yesterday for failing to reveal for more than two years that a senior Bush administration official had told him about CIA operative Valerie Plame, even as an investigation of who disclosed her identity mushroomed into a national scandal.
> 
> Woodward, an assistant managing editor and best-selling author, said he told Executive Editor Leonard Downie Jr. that he held back the information because he was worried about being subpoenaed by Patrick J. Fitzgerald, the special counsel leading the investigation.
> 
> &#8220;I apologized because I should have told him about this much sooner,&#8221; Woodward, who testified in the CIA leak investigation Monday, said in an interview. &#8220;I explained in detail that I was trying to protect my sources. That&#8217;s job number one in a case like this.&#8221;

No shit ya shoulda spoke up earlier. I can understand where he&#8217;s coming from though. I can&#8217;t say that I&#8217;d be too enthused about revealing new information in an investigation of that magnitude. I&#8217;d probably keep my mouth shut too, but this isn&#8217;t about me. [Scott at ScrappleFace][2] thinks special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald may be close to discovering who told Valerie Plame that she was an undercover CIA agent. Could it be Woodward? Sure, I don&#8217;t see why not. heh.

[Don Surber][3] is happy to see Dick Cheney speak out against the various lies about the Bush administration produced by those mostly in the democratic party. It&#8217;s definately a good thing to see. If I were in control I&#8217;d be out there blasting these guys all the time, Bush and Cheney have been too quiet until recently. From [Don Surber][3]:

> Sixty years ago, such a speech would not be necessary. People understood the need to put partisanship aside and to rally behind our troops. In Vietnam, I was told by many that they would support the military if our nation were ever attacked.  
> That too has now been proved to be a lie.

Reuters via [Yahoo News][4] on Cheney&#8217;s speech:

> &#8220;The president and I cannot prevent certain politicians from losing their memory, or their backbone &#8212; but we&#8217;re not going to sit by and let them rewrite history,&#8221; said Cheney, a principal architect of the war and a focus of Democratic allegations the administration misrepresented intelligence on Iraq&#8217;s weapons program.
> 
> Cheney said the suggestion Bush or any member of the administration misled Americans before the war &#8220;is one of the most dishonest and reprehensible charges ever aired in this city.&#8221;
> 
> &#8220;Some of the most irresponsible comments have, of course, come from politicians who actually voted in favor of authorizing force against  
> Saddam Hussein,&#8221; he said in a speech to the conservative Frontiers of Freedom Institute.

Way to go Mr. Vice President. Get right at the heart of the matter and try not to offend anyone. [The Washington Post][5] has a little on the speech by Cheney now too.
