I use [TWRP (TeamWin Recovery Project)][1] on my Nexus 4. Back in the day (read: 3 years ago) I used [ClockworkMod Recovery][2], on my Moto Defy, but have since switched to TWRP. I believe there were some licensing issues that drove a lot of people away from CWM. In any case, you&#8217;ll want to install `adb` and `fastboot` before proceeding.

From an Ubuntu distribution (Xubuntu in my case):

<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">sudo apt-get install android-tools-adb android-tools-fastboot</pre>

After adb and fastboot have been installed, boot your Nexus 4 into fastboot mode. Just switch your Nexus 4 off, then turn it back on while holding the volume down button. Keep holding the down button until you see a menu (usually with an Android guy somewhere on the screen). Entering fastboot mode may be different for your device, check the [TWRP site][1], they have instructions for a lot of different devices.

Now, make sure your PC sees your device in fastboot mode. In a terminal window, run `fastboot devices`. If nothing is printed to the terminal, something is wrong, you probably don&#8217;t have fastboot enabled. If you did see some output, you should be good to go.

Download the latest recovery `.img` file [from the TWRP site][3]. Current version as of this post is 2.7.0.0. To flash it using `fastboot`, do this in a terminal:

<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">fastboot flash recovery openrecovery-twrp-2.7.0.0-mako.img</pre>

If everything goes well, you should see something similar to this:

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <p>
    sending &#8216;recovery&#8217; (8130 KB)&#8230;<br />OKAY [ 0.510s]<br />writing &#8216;recovery&#8217;&#8230;<br />OKAY [ 0.476s]<br />finished. total time: 0.987s
  </p>
</blockquote>

If you see something other than `OKAY` messages, something is probably wrong, and I have no idea what. If you do see the `OKAY` messages, you can either reboot your phone to Android or go to recovery which will take you to TWRP. With TWRP you can make a nandroid backup, flash new roms, flash new gapps, and all kinds of other things.
