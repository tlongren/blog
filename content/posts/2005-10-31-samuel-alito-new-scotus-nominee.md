Bush [has nominated Samuel Alito][1] to [the supreme court][2]. Many thought Alito would have been the nominee to replace Rehnquist, but that went to John Roberts. Various individuals appearing on Fox News yesterday threw Alito&#8217;s name out there, expecting him to be the new nominee to replace Sandra Day O&#8217;Conner. They liked comparing him to John Roberts.

Alito is a federal judge in New Jersey and a well established conservative. Too conservative for some probably. His stances on various issues are more well known than Miers were, hopefully he&#8217;ll have an easier ride than Harriet Miers had.

I expect he won&#8217;t have many troubles along the path to the SCOTUS. Could be a little sluggish in the Senate, but what isn&#8217;t? Overall, I&#8217;m happy with Alito as the new nominee.

[Outside the Beltway][3] has some early takes on Alito. [California Conservative][4] says &#8220;Confirm Judge Alito.&#8221; [Iowa Voice][5] &#8220;can live with this&#8221;, although he&#8217;d rather see Janice Rogers Brown be the nominee. [The Political Teen][6] was hoping for a Brown nomination too. Of course, [Stop the ACLU][7] is pleased because Alito has ruled against the ACLU in the past.
