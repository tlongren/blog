Meant to post about this a bit sooner, lots of folks have written about it already, [like Tony at OMG!Droid][1]. Originally, this Ice Cream Sandwich Keyboard was available as an apk from mediafire or some other file sharing site.

Now though, the [Ice Cream Sandwich keyboard is available in the Android Market][2]. Looks pretty nifty, but not nifty enough for me to ditch SwiftkeyX. On a somewhat related note, I&#8217;m disappointed SwiftkeyX hasn&#8217;t been updated with an Ice Cream Sandwich theme.

Some features, from the Android Market page:

  * Multitouch keyboard
  * User dictionary, built-in dictionary
  * Configurable auto correction
  * Redesigned and optimized keyboard layout and style
  * Speech to text (select languages only)
  * Custom vibration intensity (haptic feedback)
  * Long press &#8220;Enter&#8221; key to bring up smiley alternatives (Only on Im mode, for example in Gtalk)
  * Long press on &#8220;/&#8221; key in URL mode to bring up domains

[ad]  
This was built by [AstronautMillionaire][3] and is in a beta status, but seems to work fine for most folks. This is in no way an official, Google build of the Ice Cream Sandwich keyboard, but it&#8217;s the best choice most of us have now.

Not too many phones have Ice Cream Sandwich ROMs available yet. [Defy has an Ice Cream Sandwich ROM][4], but it needs quite a bit of work before I&#8217;ll try it out.

If you&#8217;re looking to make your device look as close to Ice Cream Sandwich as possible, you&#8217;ll be interested in [this post I made a few weeks ago][5], its titled _[Make Cyanogenmod 7.1 Look Like Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich (Kinda)][5]_.

A video of the Ice Cream Sandwich Keyboard in action is available after the break, as well as some photos.
