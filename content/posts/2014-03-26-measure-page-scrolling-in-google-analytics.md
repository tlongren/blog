## A Google Analytics plugin for measuring page scrolling {.subtitle}

Earlier today I came across a [Google Analytics plugin called Scroll Depth][1], developed by [Rob Flaherty][2]. Here&#8217;s how he describes Scroll Depth:

> Scroll Depth is a small Google Analytics plugin that allows you to measure how far down the page your users are scrolling. It monitors the 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% scroll points, sending a Google Analytics Event at each one.
> 
> You can also track when specific elements on the page are scrolled into view. On a blog, for example, you could send a Scroll Depth event whenever the user reaches the end of a post.
> 
> The plugin supports Universal Analytics, Classic Google Analytics, and Google Tag Manager.

Scroll Depth is available [on GitHub][3] and on [it&#8217;s project page][1]. Getting it setup is easy, the only two requirements are Google Analytics and jQuery.

Below is a basic setup.

<pre class="lang:xhtml decode:true " >&lt;script src="jquery.scrolldepth.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
$(function() {
  $.scrollDepth();
});
&lt;/script&gt;</pre>

Just be sure to include `jquery.scrolldepth.min.js` and the call to `.scrollDepth()` is made after Google Analytics has been loaded up.

There&#8217;s a number of options you can pass, too:. I especially like the `elements` option. It allows you to define a unique element to record scroll events for. So, if you want to track when users scroll to the footer of a post in WordPress, you could easily set that up!

<pre class="lang:js decode:true " >$.scrollDepth({
  minHeight: 2000,
  elements: ['#comments', 'footer'],
  percentage: false,
  userTiming: false,
  pixelDepth: false
});</pre>

As stated, the only requirements are Google Analytics and jQuery. If it doesn&#8217;t seem to be working for you, ensure that Scroll Depth isn&#8217;t being loaded before your Google Analytics tracking code.
