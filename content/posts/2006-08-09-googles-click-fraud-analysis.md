So, yesterday, [Google released an analysis of click fraud][1]. Basically, Google says there&#8217;s many flaws in how click fraud consultants determine a click is fraudulent.

> A rigorous technical analysis by Google engineers has found fundamental flaws in the work of several click fraud consultants â€“ flaws that help explain why widely quoted estimates of the size of the click fraud problem are exaggerated. We would like to share this research so that advertisers can be aware of these problems and so these consultants can use the information to improve their services.

You can download the [entire PDF here][2]. It&#8217;s 17 pages and is about 165KB. The post at the [Inside Adwords blog][1] is pretty lengthy, so go [read the details][1]. The analysis done by Google included a case study on 3 of the major click fraud firms: AdWatcher, ClickFacts, and Click Forensics. Google is worried that advertisers may be making changes to their campaigns based on inaccurate data provided by these third party firms. Which could adversely affect the performance of their online marketing campaigns. Boo!!

[Adotas has a good post][3] on the subject too.
