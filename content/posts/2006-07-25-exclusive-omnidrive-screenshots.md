[Techcrunch has some exclusive screenshots][1] of [OmniDrive][2]. OmniDrive is an online storage medium, similar to those thought to be in development by [Google][3] and [Microsoft][4]. 

Michael Arrington over at Techcrunch has been using OmniDrive. Last week they released a client interface for those on Windows systems, in addition to their web-based interface. OmniDrive sounds pretty neat, although it&#8217;s still in beta. Apparently they&#8217;ll be sending out a few hundred invites each day until they&#8217;re open to the public.

They&#8217;re also going to release an API to developers, which is really cool:

> With the API a developer can either build applications that existing Omnidrive users can use, or they can create their own users and use Omnidrive purely as a backend. The API extends to being more than just saving and retrieving a file with user management, payment management, media handling and the ability for the users of a partner application to use their desktop tools to store, retrieve and access files.

Go head over to [Techcrunch to have a look][1] at the screenshots.
