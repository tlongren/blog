## Modern progress bars for your forms {.subtitle}

[Fort.js][1] is cool. It makes adding progress bars to your forms extremely easy. It&#8217;s especially useful for signup forms, or any form where it&#8217;s nice to see how far along in the process you are.

Here&#8217;s a short description from their GitHub readme:

> Modern progress bar for form completion. All you do is add the form and Fort.js&#8217; algorithm will take care of the rest. Best of all, it&#8217;s super small.

I don&#8217;t have Fort.js in use on any public facing sites yet, but will be using it for an upcoming project involving craft beers and kegs.

Fort.js comes with four different effects: [default][2], [gradient][3], [sections][4], and [flash][5]. I typically use the Sections effect, it makes it very easy to see how far along you are in the form.

I&#8217;d love Fort.js even more if changing the colors was a bit easier. Changing the progress bar colors varies depending on which effect you&#8217;re using, but it&#8217;s [all documented in the README][6].

Fort.js and related documentation can be [found on GitHub][7].

I found an example using Fort.js on Codepen.io the other day, have a look, it&#8217;s embedded below:
