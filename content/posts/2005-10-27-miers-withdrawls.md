Harriet Miers withdrew her nomination to the Supreme Court this morning. No doubt lots of people from both sides of center will be pleased with this news. I personally didn&#8217;t have an opinion one way or the other about Miers. She probably could have done a very good job filling the open SCOTUS seat. From the [Washington Post][1]:

> Harriet Miers withdrew this morning as a nominee for the U.S. Supreme Court.
> 
> In announcing the decision, Miers and President Bush cited their concern with the requests of members of the Senate Judiciary Committee for documents dealing with her work as White House Counsel that the administration has chosen to withhold as privileged.
> 
> But the Miers nomination to replace Justice Sandra Day O&#8217;Connor was in deep trouble, with little support in the Senate, open criticism from many Senators of both parties, and an outpouring of opposition from conservative activists and intellectuals.
> 
> Miers told the president in a letter of withdrawal that she was &#8220;concerned that the confirmation process presents a burden for the White House and our staff that is not in the best interests of the country.&#8221;
> 
> Bush responded that he was &#8220;reluctantly&#8221; accepting the decision.

In the long run, it&#8217;s probably good she withdrew. She was obviously someone that not many people seemed to be able to agree with on any issue. She caused enough controversy just being herself, not sure she&#8217;d work out so well had she gotten the job. [Michelle Malkin][2], [Outside The Beltway][3], and [SCOTUSblog][4] have more.

Others blogging include [TMH&#8217;s Bacon Bits][5], [Cao&#8217;s Blog][6], [Stop the ACLU][7], [Iowa Voice][8], [GOP and the City][9], and [A North American Patriot][10]. [Euphoric Reality][11] has a nice collection of links.
