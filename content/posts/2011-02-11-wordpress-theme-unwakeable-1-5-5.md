[Unwakeable 1.5.5][1] is available [for download][1].

Not a whole lot has changed since 1.5.3, but the changes that were made are significant. Unwakeable 1.5.5 is compatible with WordPress 3.1.

The most notable change is the removal of title.gif file. That was the image file with &#8220;Unwakeable&#8221; written on it that sat in the top left corner. Instead of that image, text is now used. The name of the WordPress site is pulled and used in place of the image. You can see a demo over at the [Unwakeable demo site][2].

I&#8217;ve also added support for custom menus that were introduced in WordPress 3.0. By default, the top menu is a list of pages. If you want to use a custom menu just set one up in your WordPress dashboard (Appearance &#8211;> Menus) and set that menu as the &#8220;primary navigation&#8221;.

My goal with this release of Unwakeable was to get it included in the [WordPress theme directory][3]. It&#8217;s still [pending approval or rejection][4] in the theme directory. If it&#8217;s rejected I&#8217;ll make the necessary changes, bump the version number, and submit it again.

If you&#8217;re interested in the exact changes that were made in Unwakeable 1.5.5, have a look at the following revisions in subversion:  
[r131][5]  
[r132][6]  
[r133][7]  
[r134][8]

The latest revision is [r135][9] but that was just to tag the 1.5.5 release in subversion.

If you have problems or find something broken, please [submit an issue][10] on [Github][11] and I&#8217;ll look into it.
