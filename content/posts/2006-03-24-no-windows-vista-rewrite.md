[Some news place][1] in Australia claimed an inside source at Microsoft told them 60% of the existing Windows Vista code would have to be rewritten. This news had [the][2] [techie][3] [bloggers][4] pretty excited today.

> Up to 60% of the code in the new consumer version of Microsoft new Vista operating system is set to be rewritten as the Company &#8220;scrambles&#8221; to fix internal problems a Microsoft insider has confirmed to SHN.

[Alec Saunders][3] brings the obvious to light in his post. The &#8220;obvious&#8221; of course being the logistics of such a project.

> What utter crap! 60% of Windows is millions and millions of lines of code. You canâ€™t rewrite that much code, and ship in January. Maybe January 2009 if a 60% rewrite is needed, but not January 2007. Perhaps Microsoft is in denial, and Vista will never ship, or perhaps reporter Dave Richards is a tad too quick to jump on &#8220;the sky is falling&#8221; bandwagon.

There&#8217;s absolutely no way in hell they could ship Vista by Jan 2007 if they had to do 60% of the code again. They probably should do it though, just base it off Linux or BSD and they&#8217;d be good. heh.  
[  
Microsofts Robert Scoble][5] says the 60% code rewrite claims are bogus. Thank you Robert, my mind is at ease.
