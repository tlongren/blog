I&#8217;ve been using [Heroku][1] more and more, but not for anything really valuable to me. I mostly use it for hosting one-off projects that are low traffic. A lot of times, it&#8217;ll take 30 seconds or so for the site hosted on Heroku to respond, while the [Heroku dyno][2] is woken up. If your site goes without any traffic for a certain period of time, it will [go to sleep][3].

Heroku does this to save server resources, which is a logical thing for them to do. Sometimes though, I don&#8217;t want to wait to see my site, even if I only have a free account.

I&#8217;ve seen a lot of tutorials on how to do this with Ruby, but no language-agnostic way of doing it. I also haven&#8217;t seen any way of doing this with PHP. There&#8217;s 2 methods you can use to keep your site from going to sleep.

### 1. UptimeRobot

This is the easiest and quickest way to keep your app awake, and is language-agnostic. [UptimeRobot][4] is a free service that monitors your sites. When you&#8217;re adding a new site to monitor in UptimeRobot, make sure to set the monitor type to &#8220;HTTP(s)&#8221;. UptimeRobot will check to make sure your site is up every 5 minutes, which will prevent your site from sleeping.

### 2. Heroku Scheduler

This method is a little more involved, but is probably the Heroku-preferred method.

This topic has been [covered][5] [many][6] [times][7], but always seems to focus on Ruby apps. So here&#8217;s something that will work for everyone.

While you&#8217;re viewing your app resources on the Heroku dashboard, click the &#8220;Get Add-ons&#8221; link. Add the **Heroku Scheduler** add-on to your app, it&#8217;s free.

Go back to managing your app&#8217;s resources on the Heroku dashboard, then click &#8220;Heroku Scheduler Standard&#8221; to manage the Heroku Scheduler for your app. Add a new job, and set the frequency to **Every 10 minutes**. For your task, enter **curl -I http://your-app-name.herokuapp.com**. This will fetch HTTP response headers from your app, using [Curl][8], every 10 minutes.

It should be noted that method 2 could potentially cause you to have a balance to pay at Heroku. That&#8217;s because Heroku Scheduler has [Dyno Hour Usage][9].

So, there&#8217;s two options that everyone can use to keep your Heroku apps from sleeping, no matter what language your app is written in.
