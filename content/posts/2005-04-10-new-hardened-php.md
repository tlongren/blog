A new release of [hardened-php][1] is available. For those that don&#8217;t know, hardened-php is &#8220;a group of people creating a patchset that adds security hardening features to [PHP][2] to protect your servers on the one hand against a number of well known problems in hastily written [PHP][2] scripts and on the other hand against potential unknown vulnerabilities within the engine itself&#8221;.

The current version, 0.2.7, emerged about 4 months after 0.2.6. The release of [PHP 4.3.11 and 5.0.4][2] was probably the cause for the new hardened-php release. The patch doesn&#8217;t seem to affect WordPress adversely either, or any other script for that matter.
