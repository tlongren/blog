## Validation achievement unlocked! {.subtitle}

I was invited to write an article at [Smashing Magazine][1], detailing the new [WordPress 3.9 release][2]. Can&#8217;t really explain how excited I was when I got the email.

I&#8217;m truly thankful for the opportunity and am immensely humbled by their request.

Anyone who knows web development, design, or really anything related to the Internet at all has probably heard of Smashing Magazine.

The article was put together in a very small amount of time but was a blast to do. [Daniel Pataki][3], the WordPress Editor at Smashing Magazine, was a pleasure to work with and has extreme patience (I asked him a LOT of questions). Thanks again for bearing with my sometimes dumb questions, Daniel.

The experience was awesome and I hope to continue writing articles for Smashing Magazine for a long time to come. I gave my editor a list of about 10-15 topics I&#8217;d like to cover, most of which have nothing to do with WordPress. Hopefully my ideas aren&#8217;t ALL crap, lol. `:)`

To read about WordPress 3.9 and what&#8217;s new, [head over to the Smashing Magazine piece][4]!
