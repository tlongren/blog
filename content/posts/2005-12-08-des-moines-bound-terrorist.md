**Breaking Local Terror News:**

Yesterday a man was shot and killed on an airplane in Miami when he claimed he had a bomb, due to heightened security from an airline terror alert, that much we all know.

But it is being [reported by ABC][2] that what caused the alert was a 50 year old Egyptian had been stopped in JFK Airport by the TSA in New York. His shoes were ‚Äúsuspicious‚Äù and tested positive for the explosive TATP in five separate tests. The tests revealed explosive residue on the interior of the shoe between the heel and sole. The Egyptian man was scheduled to board a flight to **Des Moines Iowa** where he claimed to be a student at Iowa State University in Ames. The man was detained overnight but released the next day **before** the FBI was notified or had a chance to speak with him. **A nationwide search is now in effect for this man** and it was this nationwide alert that caused the Miami Air Marshal to be in a heightened state of awareness when he shot and killed a man who claimed to have a bomb onboard a plane yesterday.

-The pieces of this story add up to some pretty scary stuff I you live here in Iowa:  
-A 50 year old ISU student??  
-Wearing shoes similar to those worn by shoe bomber Richard Reid  
-The FBI was not informed  
-Destined for Des Moines, Iowa

‚Ä¶and most frighteningly he is on the loose and his whereabouts unknown.

Ive seen this mentioned on only one blog on a technorati search, and just the ABC Exclusive article mentions it but it is something every Iowan at the very least should be aware of. More details may come in time. IrishWalsh told ya first.
