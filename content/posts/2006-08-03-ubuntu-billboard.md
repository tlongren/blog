Look at the beautiful Ubuntu Billboard [WildBill got a photo of][1] as he was driving by.  
[<img src="https://i2.wp.com/longren.io/wp-content/uploads/2006/08/ubuntubillboard.jpg?w=1100&#038;ssl=1" alt="Ubuntu Billboard" data-recalc-dims="1" />][1]  
Pretty neat huh? I&#8217;m not a huge Ubuntu fan, but I do appreciate it. If I wasn&#8217;t such an avid Slackware user, Ubuntu would be my distro of choice. In fact, I just used the Ubuntu LiveCd yesterday at work to get some needed files off a dying hard drive. Pretty neat, I expect Microsoft billboards, but not Ubuntu. Wonder what it&#8217;d take to get a Slackware billboard put up somewhere?

Oh, and as you&#8217;d expect, the [Ubuntu Blog author is pretty excited][2] about the billboard too.
