So, it rained about 5.5 inches here in Nevada (not the state) last Saturday. Started raining around 8:00 pm and started to taper off around 11:00 or 11:30 pm. Supposedly there were multiple tornadoes sighted around my area, but I never saw any. We also got some decent sized hail.

Josh&#8217;s dads house got pretty screwed up from a tree that fell on it&#8230;that was in Maxwell however. I saw video of the flood waters in Maxwell on the 10:00 news and it really reminded me of the 1993 floods. We&#8217;re supposed to get a couple more inches of rain today/later on this after noon.
