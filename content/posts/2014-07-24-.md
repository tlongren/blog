Many usability experts will tell you that having breadcrumb navigation on your site will help users feel like they know exactly _where_ on your site they are. It&#8217;s hard not to agree. I find myself using breadcrumbs often, especially when shopping online. An online clothing store, for example, _must_ have breadcrumb navigation. Breadcrumb navigation makes it so freaking easy to know if you&#8217;re looking at mens wear, ladies wear, kids wear, or whatever. And clothing stores can even take it much further than gender, like size, activity, material, etc.

Most sites would probably benefit from breadcrumb navigation. There are some sites that wouldn&#8217;t, though. Simple blogs would be a perfect example. They have the main blog page, maybe an About page, and maybe a Contact page. Pretty difficult to get yourself lost on a site like that. So, breadcrumbs wouldn&#8217;t make much sense in that situation.

If you think breadcrumb navigation would benefit you, and you&#8217;ve got a WordPress site, adding a custom breadcrumb navigation is super simple.
