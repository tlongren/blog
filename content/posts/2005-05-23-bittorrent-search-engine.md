[Bram Cohen][1], creator of [BitTorrent][2], says there&#8217;ll soon be a torrent search engine on [bittorrent.com][2]. There&#8217;ll be sponsored links mixed in with the search results, which isn&#8217;t anything new. They&#8217;re going to index all types of torrents I guess, even ones that help people obtain copyrighted material. I think this is pretty neat, the MPAA and RIAA might not be too exited about it though. And they have good reason not to be.

Here&#8217;s a little bit from the [Wired article][3]:

> Whiz kid inventor Bram Cohen and a small cadre of developers and entrepreneurs are in the final stage of launching an advertising-supported search engine dedicated to cataloging and indexing the thousands of movies, music tracks, software programs and other files for download over Cohen&#8217;s popular BitTorrent protocol.

I originally [read this at Slashdot][4]. It&#8217;s supposed to launch within 2 weeks. I&#8217;m excited to check it out. I wonder if the MPAA or RIAA will be purchasing any advertising space on the search engine&#8230;

**UPDATE**: Tried going to [search.bittorrent.com][5] and was presented with a &#8220;Test for apache installation&#8221; page. I&#8217;d guess the search engine will show up at that address once it&#8217;s ready. So keep an eye there if you&#8217;re interested in trying this out once it&#8217;s available.
