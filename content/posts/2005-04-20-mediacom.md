Mediacom is supposed to be out to my apartment today to fix my cable internet. It&#8217;s been out since last Tuesday (4/12). I hope they show up. When they showed up to install the cable there, the guy had to replace something in the cable box to get my internet working. I have a feeling that same piece is going to need replaced again as the symptoms I&#8217;m seeing now are the same we saw upon the initial installation.

Who knows though. I just want internet at home again, and not dial-up. I was reading on the [Mediacom Forums][1] yesterday that Mediacom DOES allow the use of routers and NAT. In their TOS, they specifically restrict the use of these items. A Mediacom employee on those forums stated yesterday that they&#8217;re getting ready to re-vamp their TOS to allow servers, routers, and multi-pc hookups. That made me so happy to hear.
