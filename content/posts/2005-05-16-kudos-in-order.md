Kudos to Mike @ [MINDSPILL][1]. He had some very [nice things to say][2] about this site.

> The first post was about Sage Mozilla Newsreader and seconds later I downloaded the software. This is a great site full of very interesting posts about the better aspects of the internet, a definite daily read.

Interesting information huh? There needs to be more interesting info to post here. There&#8217;s been a lack of it these last few days. Maybe I should make up a &#8220;recipe for tyler&#8221;, [Mike&#8217;s is killer][3]! 

<div class="wpulike wpulike-default " >
  <div class="wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked">
    <button type="button"
					aria-label="Like Button"
					data-ulike-id="1879"
					data-ulike-nonce="9a988022dc"
					data-ulike-type="likeThis"
					data-ulike-template="wpulike-default"
					data-ulike-display-likers="0"
					data-ulike-disable-pophover="0"
					class="wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_likethis_1879"></button><span class="count-box"></span>
