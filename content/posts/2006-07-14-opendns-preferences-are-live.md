I just noticed [the OpenDNS preferences page][1] is up and running. It&#8217;s pretty basic, but now you can enable or disable typo correction and phishing protection. The configuration is done based on IP address, so if you don&#8217;t have a static or persistent IP address, you might be out of luck. I don&#8217;t have a static IP at home, but I&#8217;ve managed to keep the same one for a little over a year now.

Here&#8217;s a screenshot of the preferences page:  
[<img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/static.flickr.com/56/189524049_f9b378f7af_o.png?resize=455%2C293" width="455" height="293" alt="OpenDNSPrefsSmall" data-recalc-dims="1" />][2]

Obviously, there&#8217;s not much there at this time. But look at the little information box in the top right. It mentions they&#8217;ll be adding more preferences there over time. It looks like they plan to have user accounts soon too, so you can manage preferences not based solely on your IP. Fun fun!

**UPDATE:** In my last [post on OpenDNS][3], I mentioned I was having trouble getting to http://www.tehserver.us/. The problem seemed to resolve itself, when I was suddenly able to hit tehserver.us with no problem. However, come Monday morning, I&#8217;m unable to load tehserver.us again. Even when I type http://www.tehserver.us/Home, the direct link to the homepage, I get the OpenDNS search page. OpenDNS search successfully finds the site, but when I click on the search result, I&#8217;m taken back to the OpenDNS search page instead of being taken to tehserver.us. The really odd thing is that I can reach tehserver.us with no problem from home. Not so from work though. I&#8217;d think a traceroute to tehserver.us would be nearly identical from my house and from the office, since the two are about 3 city blocks away from each other.
