There&#8217;s quite a few blogs rounding-up coverage on the london bombings from the previous 24 hours. Conservative Thinking [has the most comprehensive][1] I&#8217;ve seen this morning. It&#8217;s a question/answer sorta format, so it&#8217;s pretty easy reading. Below is a little excerpt from Conservative Thinking.

> Q. How many lost their lives in this cowardly attack?  
> A. At least 50 according to Sir Ian Blair, Metro Police Chief. Sir Ian Blair also stated that, &#8220;&#8230;the final figure was unlikely to top 100.&#8221;
> 
> Q. How did the attacks go down?  
> A. The BBC has a rather in-depth interactive timeline of the 7/7 events. But, here is a quick break down:
> 
> Explosion #1 happened at 0851 (London time) on a train about 100 meters away from the Liverpool Street station.
> 
> Explosion #2 occured at 0856 on a train in between the Russell Square and King&#8217;s Cross stations.
> 
> Explosion #3 went off at 0917 right after a train had left Edgware Road station.
> 
> Explosion #4 was the final blast during a morning of terror which occured at 0947 on one of London&#8217;s signature double-decker buses near Tavistock Square and Upper Woburn Place.

The Jawa Report [has the goods][2] on a Scotland Yard press conference. I&#8217;ve also seen reports on various sites that two more bombs were found on the bus. These bombs supposedly weren&#8217;t detonated and bomb squads were able to diffuse and remove the bombs safely. I&#8217;m not sure if this information has been confirmed or not.

If you notice any problems with this site, let me know. I&#8217;ve been getting tons of trackback spam and massive referrals from [technorati][3]. I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m getting a chance to see how much web traffic my connection can handle&#8230;

Also, [Danny Carlton][4] (aka Jack Lewis) has made up some of those banners like you&#8217;re always seeing for &#8220;make poverty history&#8221; or whatever. These are to show support for our British friends though. Very light, clean, and tasteful. I&#8217;ll probably throw some on here when I get home this evening. You can [get the banners here][5]. He&#8217;s also got a [whole bunch of links to major news sites][5] that are reporting on the london bombings. Including [Fox News][6], [Reuters][7], [Sky News][8], and [many][9] [more][10].
