Sorry for the lack of posting lately.Â  We started moving our office over the weekend.Â  Being the tech guy I had a ton of work to doy.Â  So, I spent basically the entire weekend getting all setup in the new office.

We&#8217;re moved in now and are still getting situated.Â  I&#8217;ve got a few pictures I&#8217;ll post when the whole thing is complete.Â  I ducked out a little bit early today just because I got the chance to do so.Â  Don&#8217;t expect many posts for the rest of the week unless I see something at night that really deserves attention.
