## I see this a lot {.subtitle}

I pay $90 a month for 12Mbps down and 1Mbps up. It&#8217;s all I have available. I never get 1Mbps up, at least according to [testmy.net][1]. Ping responses take quite a while, no matter the geographical location of the box I&#8217;m pinging.

` 

Of course, WindStream support folks have me test with speedtest.net, which hangs well below the 1Mbps mark. Until the end of the upload, when it gets faster, and then that&#8217;s what&#8217;s used as the result.

It&#8217;s not this bad all the time, but it&#8217;s bad way more often than it should be.

I actually miss Mediacom Cable.
