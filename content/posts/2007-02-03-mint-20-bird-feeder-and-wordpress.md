[Shaun Inman][1] has released version 2.0 of [Mint][2], [my favorite][3] website analytics software. Go over to the Mint website and have [a look at what&#8217;s new][4] in version 2.0.

If you&#8217;re a Mint 1.x user, you&#8217;ll have to pay another $19 to make the upgrade to 2.0. I purchased the upgrade for version 2.0 earlier this week and finally got around to actually upgrading earlier today. The $19 is well worth the upgrade, Mint 2.0 brings many nice new features, like the [Bird Feeder pepper][5] for example:

> Your RSS and Atom feeds attract all kinds of colorful wildlife, Bird Feeder is a window onto that activity. It highlights subscription trends across multiple Feeds and clicks on individual Seeds. Whatâ€™s a seed? Thatâ€™s bird-ese for an article or link within a feed.

Upgrading from Mint 1 was pretty painless, the only thing I&#8217;ve had issues with is the Bird Feeder pepper. There seems to be quite a bit of confusion about installing the Bird Feeder pepper. I haven&#8217;t really finished installing the Bird Feeder pepper, I don&#8217;t want to risk breaking my feeds. I&#8217;ve been watching [this thread][6] over at the Mint forums for tips. Recently, a forum user linked to a post by [Kristin Pishdadi][7], who has posted [a how-to for getting Bird Feeder working with WordPress 2][8]. She spells out step by step what needs to be done to get Bird Feeder working with your WordPress feeds. Looks pretty straight forward, I wonder if it works the same if the [WordPress Feedburner plugin][9] is being used. I need to read up some on how exactly that Feedburner plugin works first I guess.

The [wp-mint plugin][10] for WordPress should still work fine with Mint 2.0. All the javascript in Mint 2.0 is included in exactly the same fashion it was in Mint 1.x, so that plugin should still work 100%.

So, if you&#8217;re having trouble getting the Bird Feeder pepper working with WordPress, [go check out Kristin&#8217;s post][8], it&#8217;ll probably take care of your problems. It&#8217;s a lot more clear about installation than the readme that&#8217;s included with the Bird Feeder pepper. [The Mint forums][11] are an excellent resource for support issues of all types, check them out if you have problems outside the scope of Kristin&#8217;s post.
