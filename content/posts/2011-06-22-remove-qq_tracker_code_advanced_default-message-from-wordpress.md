After the latest update to the [Quantcast Quantifier plugin][1], I had a strange bit of text showing at the top of every site it was installed on.

_**qq\_tracker\_code\_advanced\_default**_ was showing at the top of every page, for no real reason.

To get that text to go away, you&#8217;ll need to go into the Quantcast Quantifier settings page. Once on that page in your WordPress dashboard, go to the _**Advanced (Optional)**_ text box. You should see that string of text in there.  
[ad]  
Simply delete that text from the _**Advanced (Optional)**_ box and save the changes. Reload your site and that text will be gone.

There seems to be a LOT of sites affected by this. Doing a search on Google for [qq\_tracker\_code\_advanced\_default][2] yields about 85000 results. I visited a few sites that showed up in results and a vast majority do have _**qq\_tracker\_code\_advanced\_default**_ at the top of the page.
