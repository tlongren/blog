[American Soldier][1] runs an awesome blog. He blogs about his time serving in the U.S. military and about his life after returning home. It&#8217;s all very interesting as he has a very unique perspective on a lot of things.

Anyway, he [got a book deal][2]. The book, called &#8220;Soldier Life: A Day in the Life of an American Soldier&#8221;, is available for pre-orders.

I [pre-ordered][3]. It&#8217;s wicked cheap if you pre-order. Unfortunately I was unable to pre-order immediately as my paypal account was dry. Money finally finished transferring to my account today, so I ordered the book today.

I am very excited for it to arrive. The book is supposed to be out in December of 2005. People who pre-order get the book a couple weeks in advance I think. Head on over to [LBF Books][4] if you&#8217;re interested in a copy. Congrats A.S.!
