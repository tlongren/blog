Sorry, I know I said I was done before, but Cindy Sheehan is a great source of entertainment, so I&#8217;m gonna put her to use. She&#8217;s comparing herself to Mary, Mother of Jesus. And while she&#8217;s doing that, she relates &#8220;devious men with evil agendas&#8221; (Bush and crew) to christs killers.

This doesn&#8217;t offend me at all because I&#8217;m not a religious guy, it&#8217;s just funny as hell. I still can&#8217;t believe how delusional she is:

> On Ash Wednesday of 2004, a few days before Casey left for Iraq, his dad and I went to see The Passion of the Christ. That was our Ash Wednesday penance that year. Caseyâ€™s dad fell asleep during the scourging scene while I sat in my seat and quietly sobbed. I was especially touched by the character that played Jesusâ€™ mom who followed her son along while he was being violently tortured and killed by devious men with an evil agenda. Of course, since I became a mom over 26 years ago, I have identified with Mary as she sobbed at the foot of her sons cross and cradled his lifeless body in her arms.

[The Political Teen][1] was responsible for helping me find this. [Decision &#8217;08][2] has the link to Cindy&#8217;s full HuffPo entry.
