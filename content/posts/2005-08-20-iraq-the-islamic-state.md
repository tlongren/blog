Sounds like it could be. I just hope it&#8217;s not true. [Reuters is reporting][1] that U.S. diplomats have basically just said screw it and are allowing Islam to be &#8220;the&#8221; religion of Iraq. This can&#8217;t be a good idea, Islam is basically what we&#8217;re at war with here. How they could just allow this is beyond me.

> BAGHDAD (Reuters) &#8211; U.S. diplomats have conceded ground to Islamists on the role of religion in Iraq, negotiators said on Saturday as they raced to meet a 48-hour deadline to draft a constitution under intense U.S. pressure.
> 
> U.S. diplomats, who have insisted the constitution must enshrine ideals of equal rights and democracy, declined comment.
> 
> Shi&#8217;ite, Sunni and Kurdish negotiators all said there was accord on a bigger role for Islamic law than Iraq had before.
> 
> But a secular Kurdish politician said Kurds opposed making Islam &#8220;the,&#8221; not &#8220;a,&#8221; main source of law &#8212; changing current wording &#8212; and subjecting all legislation to a religious test.

It doesn&#8217;t really suprise me. They&#8217;ve got what, three major ethnic groups in Iraq? All fighting for control certain areas of Iraq. It&#8217;s just not gonna work. If I had a say, I&#8217;d tell them flat out they cannot have a government built around a specific religion. I don&#8217;t think they should be focusing on splitting Iraq up into somewhat seperate entities at all. Sure, that might work 20 years down the road, but not now!

It&#8217;s really sad. All the lives and money lost just to allow something like this to take place. Makes no sense to me. Maybe I just don&#8217;t see the entire picture, who knows. _If_ this really happens, in 15 years Iraq will be in the same state it was in 2000.

In the Bullpen was the first place I read about this. [Mac agrees that if true][2], this could be really, really bad. Richard at Hyscience has very relavent things to say about it. I [think his summary][3] is a little clearer than mine. Patrick over at Clarity and Resolve [sums the whole thing up quite nicely][4] with this quote &#8220;a statement of Islam&#8217;s utter failure at compatibility with the principles of rights and freedom&#8221;. That&#8217;s pretty much how I see it too Patrick.

The Fourth Rail [has a great post][5] about Islam, al Qaeda, and the future of Iraq. I highly recommend it.

I&#8217;ll post updates when/if there are some. In the meantime, go have some fun at the [OTB Caption Jam][6] or checkout what [Basil has for brunch today][7].
