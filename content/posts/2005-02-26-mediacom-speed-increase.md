Rumors are going around that Mediacom, my cable internet provider, is going to raise their speeds from 3mbit to 5mbit.

Here&#8217;s the original article I saw:  
[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/&#8230;/vnu\_content\_id=1000799921][1]

It&#8217;s on that page, under the &#8220;Faster cable modem speeds: Mediacom&#8221; headline. I haven&#8217;t heard anything about increasing the upload speed, but I assume that will come along with the download speed increase.

Supposedly it&#8217;s gonna be rolled out sometime in March of this year. Some people seem to think the 5mbit down will be only for the &#8220;heaviest&#8221; users, who are willing to pay a little more for the extra speed. Either way, I&#8217;m excited.

Mediacom doubled their speeds from 1.5mbit to 3mbit in February of 2004. That was a free upgrade to all of their high speed internet customers.
