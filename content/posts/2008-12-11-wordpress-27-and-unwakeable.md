[WordPress 2.7 &#8220;Coltrane&#8221;][1] is out. The new dashboard is a nice change, it makes getting around much easier. Here&#8217;s a bit from the [release announcement][1]:

> The first thing youâ€™ll notice about 2.7 is its new interface. From the top down, weâ€™ve listened to your feedback and thought deeply about the design and the result is a WordPress thatâ€™s just plain faster. Nearly every task you do on your blog will **take fewer clicks and be faster** in 2.7 than it did in a previous version.

The latest stable version of [Unwakeable][2], 1.5.1, seems to work just fine with WordPress 2.7, from what I&#8217;ve seen anyway. If you have any problems with Unwakeable 1.5.1 with WordPress 2.7, you may want to give [Unwakeable 1.5.2 release candidate 1][3] a shot. As of this post, it&#8217;s current with [K2 r739][4]. Unwakeable 1.5.2 rc1 is currently running this site and appears to be very stable. I hope to have Unwakeable ready for inclusion in the [WordPress theme directory][5] by the time 1.5.2 is officially released.

If you have any problems with either of these versions of Unwakeable, please let me know by leaving at comment at the [Unwakeable page][2].
