The post title pretty much sums this one up. CouponAudit produced, with a little help from longren.org, an infographic showing **Global Cell Phone Statistics**. I&#8217;m not usually a fan of infographics but this one appealed to me due to it&#8217;s simplicity and the fact that I am pretty obsessed with smartphones, tablets, and other portable devices.

There&#8217;s not too many surprising things in it, but it&#8217;s interesting to note that **older age groups (30+) have a higher percentage of e-readers compared with their younger (16 to 29) peers**. I guess that makes sense, people like **my mom and aunt are more likely to buy a Kindle or similar device than I am**. I always go Android, unless I&#8217;m gifted an iOS device. Some e-readers just don&#8217;t have the flexibility that they should.

Somewhat surprisingly, **only 25.6% of people in the 25 to 34 age group have smartphones**. 25.6% is the highest percent from all the age groups, too. Every [meatspace friend][1] that I can think of owns a smartphone, so I&#8217;m not sure I totally agree with those numbers. _Actually_, there&#8217;s one friend who doesn&#8217;t own a smartphone, and he is probably the only IT Director in the country without a smartphone, but he refuses to get one. Most of my friends are in the 25 to 34 age range, with some quite older friends who even have smartphones. Perhaps it&#8217;s just due to the company I keep, who knows.

More interesting facts:

### **1.** More than $150 billion was spent on mobile media globally in 2013.

### **2.** The average american household spent, on average, $1,226 in 2013 for phone services. In 2007 it was $1,110 a year.

### **3.** Samsung continues to be the most prolific manufacturers of smartphones and dumb phones.

### **4.** 68% of smartphones run some version of Android, with 16.9% running Apple&#8217;s iOS.

### **5.** Android recently hit 50 billion downloads on the [Play Store][2].

### **6.** The Apple AppStore hit 50 billion downloads 6 months earlier, but I think it had a considerable head-start with a well established app ecosystem from the git-go.
