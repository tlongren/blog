Optimization can drastically change the way your websites load. Poorly optimized sites load slowly and aren&#8217;t very nice to look at for the users. Well optimized sites load quickly and provide the user with the content they need. There&#8217;s lots of different ways to optimize site performance. You can optimize apache, mysql, PHP, and even your HTML code.

One thing people often overlook when optimizing a site is the CSS. [Blogging Pro takes a look at four different][1] CSS optimization tools. I, for one, have never really thought of optimizing CSS. I just don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s really ever occurred to me, I need to work on learning CSS before I get into optimization. But, there&#8217;s tools to do the optimizing for you, go check out the [article at Blogging Pro][1].
