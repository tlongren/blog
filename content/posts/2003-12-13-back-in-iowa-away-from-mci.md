I decided to come back to Iowa for the weekend. I&#8217;m probably gonna be going back to Chicago sometime on Monday.

MCI hasn&#8217;t been at all helpful with getting our DS-3 connection installed. One of their employees, who isn&#8217;t even assigned to our project, ended up connecting everything for us. We couldn&#8217;t get anybody else to do it on the MCI end.

Hopefully the Cisco 7206 router will be fully configured when I get back on Monday. That way we don&#8217;t have to use AOL dial-up for internet access. Hasn&#8217;t been a good couple of weeks.
