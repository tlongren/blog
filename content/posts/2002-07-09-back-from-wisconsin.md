I got back from Wisconsin yesterday. I went up there for my step-sisters wedding and to visit my father and step-mother. The website has been down since I went up there. I had to take nightengale with me (of course).

I&#8217;m going to look at a few apartments later on today. Hopefully we find one that we like soon. <A href=http://www.vrac.iastate.edu/~dshipton/>Dan</a> has to move out of his current apartment soon. 

<div class="wpulike wpulike-default " >
  <div class="wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked">
    <button type="button"
					aria-label="Like Button"
					data-ulike-id="1508"
					data-ulike-nonce="a28aec20e7"
					data-ulike-type="likeThis"
					data-ulike-template="wpulike-default"
					data-ulike-display-likers="0"
					data-ulike-disable-pophover="0"
					class="wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_likethis_1508"></button><span class="count-box"></span>
