I got my car back yesterday. It&#8217;s a shame though cuz now I don&#8217;t get to drive the caddie to work anymore. Oh well, it&#8217;s kinda nice to have my own car back. I took the face to my cd player out when I left my car over night in Ankeny. I put it in Josh&#8217;s car, and forgot to grab it when his car died&#8230;so now I&#8217;m without a face to my cd player. It was a long drive to work this morning without anything to listen to. Hopefully I&#8217;ll get it back from him tonight.
