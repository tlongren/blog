This kicks ass. Last week, I saw Halo 2 for download on a few BitTorrent websites. I&#8217;m not even gonna download and burn it. Reasons:  
1. I have no DVD Burner  
2. I don&#8217;t have a modchip for my xbox  
3. I wanna buy it

I visited one of the sites today (<a href=http://www.elitetorrents.org>www.elitetorrents.org</a>), and noticed they had removed Halo 2! This is awesome to see! The fact that these people respect the game of Halo enough to not release it is absolutely killer. Instead of offering it for download, they&#8217;re telling everyone to go out and buy it.

I should probably pre-order a copy just to be sure I can get it when it comes out. November 9th is coming around quickly! Go Bungie! w00t!
