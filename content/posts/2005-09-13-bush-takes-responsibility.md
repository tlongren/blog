President George W. Bush said &#8220;I take responsiblity&#8221; for failures in the response to Katrina. Here&#8217;s a quote from the [AP article][1].

> President Bush said Tuesday that &#8220;I take responsibility&#8221; for failures in dealing with Hurricane Katrina and said the disaster raised broader questions about the government&#8217;s ability to respond to natural disasters as well as terror attacks.
> 
> &#8220;Katrina exposed serious problems in our response capability at all levels of government,&#8221; Bush said at joint White House news conference with the president of Iraq. 

Yah, he came out and took responsibility. That takes serious balls. Wonderful job Mr. President, I commend you. Don&#8217;t expect the left to stop attacking you, they probably won&#8217;t even acknowledge that you accepted responsibility. It&#8217;s just how they are.

I don&#8217;t feel that Bush should have taken responsibility though. If anyone should, it should be Governor Blanco. She needed the 24 hours to make a decision. Had Bush gone over her head people would have been bitching about the federal government imposing on the rights of the state governments. It&#8217;s a lose-lose situation no matter what for President Bush. This should make for some interesting posts throughout the blogsphere later on&#8230;

Jeff Goldstein at [Protein Wisdom][2] is also saddened by Bush&#8217;s statements and notes that peopel on the left are &#8220;fucking insane&#8221;. Well put.

Others covering include Dan at [Riehl World View][3], [Mark in Mexico][4], [Of The Mind][5], and [Rob Port of Say Anything][6].
