I changed the WordPress theme for this site. I didn&#8217;t really like the looks of the old one anymore and it had this funky thing going on at the very top of the page. There was a little white space at the top that I could&#8217;t get to go away. I&#8217;d seen this theme in use a few places and really liked it.

The theme I&#8217;m using now is Almost Spring by [Beccary][1]. I modified the colors a bit, but that&#8217;s basically it. I didn&#8217;t want to have the default greenish look that others use. I don&#8217;t know how satisfied I am with these colors, but they&#8217;ll do for now. I have this awesome color selecting site bookmarked at work, so I may decide to change colors a bit. I can&#8217;t find the site now that I&#8217;m at home, so I just randomly picked similar colors I guess.

Anyone have any thoughts on the new theme? 

<div class="wpulike wpulike-default " >
  <div class="wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked">
    <button type="button"
					aria-label="Like Button"
					data-ulike-id="1831"
					data-ulike-nonce="ed27392828"
					data-ulike-type="likeThis"
					data-ulike-template="wpulike-default"
					data-ulike-display-likers="0"
					data-ulike-disable-pophover="0"
					class="wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_likethis_1831"></button><span class="count-box"></span>
  </div>
