I think everyone knows about DooM. The classic first-person shooter. It was my favorite game for a long time. I haven&#8217;t got the new Doom yet for my Xbox, but I plan on getting it. I don&#8217;t have a big enough video card to play on my PC. Oh, I almost forgot the Doom books! Those are the best books I&#8217;ve ever read I think. The game definately holds true to the books. I think there&#8217;s 4 or 5 books. I was hoping to see a game for each book, didn&#8217;t happen unfortunately.

Anyway, production on a Doom movie have been in progress for a while now. Originally it was scheduled to release in June in North America. That launch date has been pushed back to October. 

The article at [GamesIndustry.biz][1] states that the movie might not hold too true to the game, which sucks. They talk about an invasion from hell in the article. I don&#8217;t remember an inavsion from hell, I just remember a bunch of stuff from Mars two moons, Phobos and Deimos.

[Slashdot][2] had a story about the movie a year ago or so. I remember they said it&#8217;s supposed to be a really bloddy and gory movie. I&#8217;m excited to see it wether it holds true to the game or not.
