I&#8217;m testing out a new look for this website. Still trying to decide on the color scheme. I&#8217;m not quite sure about the blue in the background.

This style of website is quite common for blogs. I&#8217;ve seen it all over the place so I did something similar. The links on the right don&#8217;t use the &#8220;clicky hand&#8221; under Mozilla Firefox like they do in Internet Explorer. I&#8217;m still working a few things out. If you notice anything that needs fixing, please contact me!!! I&#8217;m sure the contact form works, so you can use that. 

<div class="wpulike wpulike-default " >
