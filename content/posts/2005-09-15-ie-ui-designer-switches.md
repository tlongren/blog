Scott Berkun was the UI designer for Internet Explorer (versions 1.0 through 5.0). He&#8217;s decided to make the switch to Firefox, for various reasons.

> Itâ€™s a sad day and a good day. For years Iâ€™ve held onto my IE install out of love. I worked on IE 1.0 thru 5.0, and was one of the people that designed much of its UI. But my love for the past has faded. Last week I switched to Firefox: and Iâ€™ve been happy.

Check out [his reasons][1] for switching to Firefox and some UI changes he might make in Firefox. Makes for a good read, especially coming from a guy who was an IE developer.
