## I&#8217;ll show you how to restore the backup, too!

I like to use simple bash scripts to do various tasks. Backing up MySQL is one of them.

I recently decided to start compressing my MySQL backups, as I started including all databases in one fell swoop. I use [bzip2][1] to compress the `.sql` files produced by [mysqldump][2]. [bzip2 is standard][3] on pretty much every *nix operating system, so you likely won&#8217;t need to install it.

I&#8217;m also using [Tarsnap][4] for backups now, which is a great service, btw. So cutting the size down on the backups sent to [Tarsnap][4] will save me a bit of money. <del>I&#8217;ll be doing an article later on that focuses entirely on Tarsnap.</del>. I&#8217;m pretty in love with it. You can find an article about [installing and using Tarsnap, right here at longren.io][5].

</div>

Anyway, here&#8217;s the command I use to backup and compress all databases on my MySQL server: 

<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">mysqldump -uroot -p --opt --all-databases | bzip2 -cq9 &gt; /home/tyler/mysql-backups/backupname.sql.bz2</pre>

That will create a backup of all databases. The `-cq9` piece in the `bzip2` command uses stdin for input and tells bzip2 to be quiet. The number, 9, specifies the compression level that bzip2 should use.

The script embedded in [the Gist below][6] is what I use to all my databases to _/home/tyler/mysql-backups/_, and then that folder gets backed up to [Tarsnap][4].  
https://gist.github.com/tlongren/85e0d7d04cd507b1ec53

To restore the database, you&#8217;ll want to `bunzip2` the `.sql.bz2` file first: 

<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">bunzip2 backupname.sql.bz2</pre>

That will leave you with a `backupname.sql` file. Then bring the resulting `.sql` file into MySQL like so: 

<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">mysql -uroot -pyourpasswordfornoprompt &lt; backupname.sql</pre>

The databases will need to either already exist, or there will need to be `CREATE DATABASE` statements in the `.sql` file. It&#8217;s up to you. I like to create my databases before hand, but it&#8217;s just personal preference.

That&#8217;s all there is to it. How do you take care of your backups? I&#8217;d love to hear how others are doing it. Comments are open.

There&#8217;s a [thread going on at Hacker News][7], too.

**Update:** Made a slight modification to the code and gist [suggested by sluggo][8].

**Update 2:** HackerNews user [Nanzikambe][9] suggested the [method above will destroy disk I/O on your server][10]. He [suggests using ZFS snapshots][11] instead. The example he posted is in the Gist below, and includes the ability to send the backup to a remote server. A good [tutorial on backing up MySQL using ZFS can be found here][12].
