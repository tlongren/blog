Two Unwakeable releases within a month is a record. Anyway, Unwakeable 1.5.6 is [available for download][1].

[Unwakeable was again denied][2] for inclusion in the [WordPress Themes Directory][3]. All the issues you see listed on that trac ticket have been fixed. I have yet to submit Unwakeable 1.5.6 to the themes directory.

You can find a detailed list of changes at the [Unwakeable GitHub repo][4]. If you notice any problems please [report an issue][5].

The biggest change in 1.5.6 is the inclusion of [comment_form][6]. The WordPress Themes Directory requires use of comment\_form. K2 had a custom form in place for comments, so I removed that form and replaced it with the comment\_form function. Changes other than that were pretty negligible (ie: replacing blog\_info(&#8216;url&#8217;) with &#8216;echo home\_url()&#8217;).

You can see Unwakeable 1.5.6 [in action here][7].
