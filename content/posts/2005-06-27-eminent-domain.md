So, our government hates us. A few days ago, the [Supreme Court ruled][1] on eminent domain powers. They came to the conclusion that state entities can take private property as long as it&#8217;ll generate some sort of tax revenue. I was so freakin pissed off when I heard this. I honestly can&#8217;t believe this is happening, although it doesn&#8217;t suprise me. I hope to god something is done about this, cuz it&#8217;s gonna lead to the downfall of our current govt. Not that it&#8217;s a bad thing.

As you can probably imagine, there&#8217;s a lotta pissed off people. [VodkaPundit][2] says &#8220;This ruling is a license for corruption and abuse.&#8221; I think he hit it pretty head on there, because it&#8217;s true. Businesses will just start giving money to the government to get private property. I&#8217;m sad.

And over at [SayUncle][3], they have tons of commentary and all sorts of updates on the story. This is the stuff revolutions are made of. I liked the post title about this over @ [Wizbang][4], it reads &#8220;All Your Property Are Belong To US&#8221;. Funny.
