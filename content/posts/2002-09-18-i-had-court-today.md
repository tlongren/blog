I had my court date today. I ended up having to pay $90. I figured I&#8217;d have to pay a lot more than that. Here&#8217;s how the money was broken up:

Non-Scheduled Charge: $25.00  
Fines: $50.00  
Court Fee: $15.00

The judge asked me how I plead. Of course, I plead guilty. He set my fine at $50, and that was about it. I went to the other room and paid my fees.
