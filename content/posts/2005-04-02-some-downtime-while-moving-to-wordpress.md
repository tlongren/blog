This site was down for a bit yesterday due to a cable outage here in town. TV and everything was out through all of Nevada.

Came back up within about 2 hours. Was also down for a bit today while I was messing with MySQL and PHP. I&#8217;m moving this site over to [WordPress][1], so I compiled PHP 4 as WP supposedly won&#8217;t work with PHP 5. I don&#8217;t need any special features from PHP 5, so I decided to downgrade.

I don&#8217;t really know why I&#8217;m moving to WordPress. I guess I&#8217;m just tired of this custom blog code so I&#8217;m gonna switch to something that&#8217;s more widely used. I think it should help attract more visitors also.

I don&#8217;t really know when I&#8217;ll have everything moved over, it&#8217;ll probably take me a couple of weeks to complete. I need to find a good WordPress template that isn&#8217;t being used all over the web. The default, Kubrick, is wicked popular, so I dun think I&#8217;ll be using that one.

Expect some downtime while moving to WordPress, although downtime should be pretty minimal. 

<div class="wpulike wpulike-default " >
  <div class="wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked">
    <button type="button"
					aria-label="Like Button"
					data-ulike-id="1762"
					data-ulike-nonce="f252fd5a3a"
					data-ulike-type="likeThis"
					data-ulike-template="wpulike-default"
					data-ulike-display-likers="0"
					data-ulike-disable-pophover="0"
					class="wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_likethis_1762"></button><span class="count-box"></span>
