I just did an update on my local WordPress subversion trunk and noticed the version had been updated to 2.0. No more release candidate, this is the final 2.0 WordPress release. Not many changes between 2.0-Final and RC3. I think there were maybe a total of 15 files that had any changes to them, if that many.

The [WordPress.org][1] site is down for the time being, displaying a message:

> Switching servers, please check back in about a half hour. Thanks! &#8211; Matt

Probably getting ready to announce WordPress 2.0 on the site. Congratulations to the WordPress team on another fine release.
