Well, I&#8217;m not sure if it was actually a rocket. The [article says rockets were fired][1], and then they say that a mortar sailed over a U.S. ship. They probably just don&#8217;t know the difference between rockets and mortars. They&#8217;re the stupid media, why the hell should they care if their content is accurate? They both explode, so what&#8217;s the difference?

I kinda find this amusing, because who would be stupid enough to launch a rocket attack against U.S. naval ships during this period in time? Patrick, over at [Clarity and Resolve][2] turned me on to this first.

[Riehl World View has a few updates][3]. Dan says the attacks were caused by &#8220;Katyusha rockets fired from a poor neighborhood on the outskirts of Aqaba&#8221;. Stupid, stupid, stupid. Those guys must have some huge ass balls.

Mad Dog Vinnie at [The Jawa Report][4] filed this under &#8220;Not A Wise Thing To Do At This Point In History&#8221;. It would be a wise thing to do if you want to die, not that many people want to die. They&#8217;re just lucky they are sucky shots and missed.
