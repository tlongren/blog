Want to change your WordPress sidebar but don&#8217;t wanna edit any code? The [WordPress Widgets Plugin][1] is just what you&#8217;re looking for.

It made it&#8217;s debut on [WordPress.com][2] a few months ago and is now being released for public consumption. If everything goes well, it might get included in the next WordPress release.

> Widgets are an easy way for you to arrange and rearrange your sidebar to your hearts content without touching a line of code. We first launched WordPress Widgets (WPW) it on WordPress.com a month ago and the response was great. Now weâ€™re ready to release the plugin to the world. If adoption goes well, weâ€™ll consider rolling it into the next version of WordPress.

You can get the plugin [here][3]. [WordPress Theme Park][4] notes that theme developers will want to try to make their themes work out-of-the-box with this plugin. It&#8217;s apparently [pretty easy][5]. 

<div class="wpulike wpulike-default " >
  <div class="wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked">
    <button type="button"
					aria-label="Like Button"
					data-ulike-id="2139"
					data-ulike-nonce="f788df4400"
					data-ulike-type="likeThis"
					data-ulike-template="wpulike-default"
					data-ulike-display-likers="0"
					data-ulike-disable-pophover="0"
					class="wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_likethis_2139"></button><span class="count-box"></span>
