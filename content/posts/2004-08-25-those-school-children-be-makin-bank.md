I was watchin [Fox News][1] Monday over lunch and they were talking about some state that&#8217;s going give children gift certificates for doing well in school. Some of the gift certificates are worth up to $150!

And now Krispy Kreme is jumping in also. They&#8217;re offering free doughnuts to children for each &#8220;A&#8221; on their report card.

What I wouldn&#8217;t give to be in school again, gift certificates, Krispy Kreme, it dun get any better than that! Kids these days&#8230;
