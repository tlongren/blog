[Google Web Accelerator][1] was announced today on the [Google Blog][2]:

> This calls out loud and clear for a way to optimize time. One mundane time-waster we all contend with, for example, is waiting for web pages to load. The tantalizing promise of a web page is only seconds away. But even on broadband, the wait&#8217;s too short to do something else &#8211; and just long enough to be irritating. Let&#8217;s face it, those seconds add up.
> 
> As you may have noticed, we&#8217;re slightly obsessed with speed around here. When you search on Google.com, your results are returned to you within fractions of a second. And now comes Google Web Accelerator. After you download it, we hope you&#8217;ll enjoy that same Google-fast experience across the rest of the web. After all, seconds add up to minutes.

Looks pretty neat. I thought it only worked in Internet Explorer to begin. After installing it however I noticed it showed up in [Firefox][3] too! That&#8217;s kick ass that Google is building support for Firefox in their tools now too. I knew this time would come soon. Pretty neat!

HOWEVER, when Google Web Accelerator is enabled, I&#8217;m unable to post entries to this blog and a few other things. I also can&#8217;t login to site that sets a cookie or temporary session id when it&#8217;s enabled. Gonna have to read a bit more about it. And&#8230;I dunno about Internet Explorer and I don&#8217;t care.
