I&#8217;m mostly done moving in now. Hopefully the cable will be installed soon. If you&#8217;re reading this, then it has been installed. ðŸ™‚

Anyway, the Iraqi elections went over pretty well. From what I heard, there wasn&#8217;t too much violence around the country. The only news source I had during all this was ABC, CBC, NBC, and Fox (not Fox News)&#8230;so I felt kinda left out. I wish I would have had internet access so I could have read all the blogs yesterday.

I tried to read a couple today @ work but I was really busy all day. Did more work on the order verification system. It&#8217;s slowly but surely getting there.

I&#8217;ve got all my pc&#8217;s running in my new place now. The router is patiently waiting for an IP address from Mediacom. As soon as it gets one, this website will be back online.
