Lots of people have been searching for &#8220;lynndie england photos uncensored&#8221; and &#8220;lynndie england uncensored&#8221;.

> Under a deal she made with military prosecutors, the reservist from Fort Ashby, W.Va., will serve less than the maximum term of 11 years in prison that could result from her guilty plea. She had faced nine counts and could have received up to 161/2 years. A military jury will decide her sentence this week.
