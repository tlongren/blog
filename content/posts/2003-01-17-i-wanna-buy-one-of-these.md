I really want to get one of these. I&#8217;d like to be able to use it for projects in school. I&#8217;d like to possible write some software to use with it. I would probably also install Linux on it. Linux and PDA&#8217;s go very, very good together. 

<div class="wpulike wpulike-default " >
  <div class="wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked">
    <button type="button"
					aria-label="Like Button"
					data-ulike-id="1550"
					data-ulike-nonce="9d73eca8f8"
					data-ulike-type="likeThis"
					data-ulike-template="wpulike-default"
					data-ulike-display-likers="0"
					data-ulike-disable-pophover="0"
					class="wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_likethis_1550"></button><span class="count-box"></span>
