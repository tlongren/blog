This is too good to pass up. Everyone in the world knows that George W. Bush is to blame for basically every problem the world has. It&#8217;s just a fact. For example: The Iowa vs. Iowa State game is this weekend in Ames. It&#8217;s entirely Bush&#8217;s fault it&#8217;s in Ames. Now I won&#8217;t be able to get around quickly to my usual destinations. In relation to that I&#8217;ll end up spending more money on gasoline. It&#8217;s in Ames because there&#8217;s a slightly higher black population in Iowa City rather than in Ames. And you know, Bush hates black people, so the fewer the better. I&#8217;m just glad to see that our president is able to keep on top of so many things.

Yah, I don&#8217;t really have much talent for satire, so I&#8217;ll just let you [read the good stuff for yourself][1]. This is the first time I&#8217;ve seen [Six Meat Buffet][2] &#8220;lash out&#8221; at president Bush like this. ðŸ˜‰

Bush is getting blamed for basically everything. It&#8217;s not even humanly possible for one man to be responsible for everything people are blaming on him. It&#8217;s sad but also totally funny. The left in this country will believe anything they read on Daily Kos or Democratic Underground. Their brains have gotta be almost totally wasted away.
