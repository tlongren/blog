## Hover all the things!

[I&#8217;ve used Hover.css in previous projects][1] and love it. As described by it&#8217;s author:

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <p>
    A collection of CSS3 powered hover effects to be applied to call to actions, buttons, logos, featured images and so on. Easily apply to your own elements, modify or just use for inspiration. Available in CSS and SASS.
  </p>
</blockquote>

I recently stumbled on [iHover][2], which is very similar to **Hover.css**. The only major difference is their homepage demo&#8217;s. Hover.css uses text, iHover uses images in their demos.

Here&#8217;s how iHover is described on it&#8217;s website:

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <p>
    iHover is an impressive hover effects collection, powered by pure CSS3, no dependency, work well with Bootstrap 3!
  </p>
</blockquote>

**Hover.css** is quite a bit smaller than **iHover** is, but it&#8217;s not as feature packed. That&#8217;s the exact reason that I&#8217;ve used **Hover.css** in previous projects. It&#8217;s so small but gives so many neat hover effects.

iHover effects are mostly taken from [codrops articles][3], and was [inspired specifically by this article on codrops][4].

You can find a [demo of iHover here][2] and a [demo of Hover.css here][1].

Both iHover and Hover.css are on GitHub. [iHover can be found on GitHub here][5], while [Hover.css can be found on GitHub here][6].

What do you think? Would you ever use one of these? Have you used either, or something similar?
