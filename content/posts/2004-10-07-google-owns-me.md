They really do. This new SMS thing they have is awesome! Say you want to find pizza places in Ames, Iowa. Send an SMS message (text message) via your phone to US shortcode 46645. In the body of the SMS, you&#8217;d write &#8220;pizza 50014&#8221; or &#8220;pizza Ames, IA&#8221;.

Within a few seconds, google will respond with another SMS giving you the address and phone number to pizza places in Ames.

There&#8217;s tons of other things it can do too, like gather prices, find phone numbers, and get word definitions. A killer tool for anyone that&#8217;s got a cell phone and travels a lot.

Here&#8217;s the link:

  <div class="wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked">
