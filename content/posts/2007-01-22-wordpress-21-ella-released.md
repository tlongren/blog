[WordPress 2.1 &#8220;Ella&#8221;][1] has officially been released. [Go download][2] or go have [a look at what&#8217;s new][1] in 2.1.

WordPress 2.1 includes [over 550 bug fixes][3]. Might want to start thinking about making the upgrade to 2.1. Make sure all the plugins you use are supported by 2.1 first though, [here&#8217;s a list of plugins supported][4] in WordPress 2.1.
