[Stop the ACLU][1] has news of a &#8220;boy love&#8221; blog that&#8217;s being hosted by google. This [sick fuck of a blogger][2] thinks little boys are his sexual play things. Well, he may not think that precisely, but he might as well. This is from Wordlnet Daily:

> A marriage and family therapist is trying to convince Google to drop a website from its popular, free blog host that promotes “boy love,” sexual relationships between men and adolescents.
> 
> Stacy L. Harp of Orange, Calif., told WorldNetDaily one of the readers of her weblog pointed out the site, called “Paiderastia: The Boy Love Revival.”
> 
> At the top of its homepage, the site explains it’s all about “erotic/mentor/spiritual love between adolescents and adults.”
> 
> Harp said, however, that not long after she exposed it yesterday morning, the “Paiderastia” site removed its most recent posts, including one dated April 9.
> 
> Also removed, according to Harp, was a podcast – a file with a radio-style report – that mocked the FBI. It was created through the podcast provider Liberated Syndication. 

Here&#8217;s a bit from the blog itself, at least this asshat realizes he doesn&#8217;t have &#8220;right&#8221; to make love to boys.

> I just now got around to reading the post that included the Boylove Code of Ethics, and I really really like this Code of Ethics. These things are very important, and more of us need to remember them. We have to remember that sex is not an entitlement. In other words, just because we have a sexual attraction to boys (that we did not choose to have) does not mean that we have the right to pursue a sexual relationship with a boy. That isn&#8217;t to say that the sexual relationship in itself is wrong.

Sicko. I&#8217;m sorry, but it&#8217;s just wrong. The fact that these guys have a code of ethics is just plain weird. How the fuck are these dudes gonna have a code of fuckin ethics? They&#8217;re banging little boys for fuck sake! Google had better pull that site, or I&#8217;m boycotting.

Rusty at [The Jawa Report][3] seems pretty disgusted by this too, rightly so. They&#8217;ve got a few other pedophile sites listed also.

[The Dread Pundit][4] is wondering why sites with anti-islamist artwork have a warning before you can enter and these boy love sites don&#8217;t. He brings up a very good point. I realize Google can&#8217;t keep tabs on all these blogs, but come on. If any sites should present warnings before entering, it should be these boy love sites.

Check out the [war against NAMBLA][5] too.
