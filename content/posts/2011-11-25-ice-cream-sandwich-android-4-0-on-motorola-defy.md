[Epsylon3 has managed to boot Ice Cream Sandwich][1] on the Motorola Defy. As you can imagine, lots of things still don&#8217;t work, like 3G and the orientation sensor.

Epsylon3 also released the first test ROM for Motorola Defy phones. The download link has been shutdown due to &#8220;copyright abuse&#8221;. The test ROM was made available at <http://defy-cm7.tk//ics-test0/>. I doubt it will come back online, so keep an eye on [the original thread at XDA][1] for a new download link.

**Things that work in the test ROM:**

  * Startup, bootmenu and recovery
  * Touchscreen and keypad (multitouch too)
  * Usb
  * New Network (netfilter) kernel modules (quota2, and fake qtaguid)
  * wifi

**Things that need work:**

  * Fix egl configuration : Cause the force close on many apps including default launcher, settings and gapps setup wizard
  * Fix colors (almost fixed)
  * Fix sound
  * Fix phone / 3G
  * Fix orientation sensor
  * Fix egl hw acceleration for omap3 (can be hard) : gralloc.omap3.so
  * Fix camera (will be hard)

_**UPDATE 11/29/2011:** See [this post for links][2] to some Cyanogenmod 9 test builds for the Defy._
