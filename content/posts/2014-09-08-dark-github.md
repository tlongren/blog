## GitHub Lights Out {.subtitle}

I love the [GitHub explore today emails][1]. It&#8217;s a daily email consisting of currently trending repositories, repositories starred by people you follow, and repositories that have been starred by GitHub staff members.

The September 06, 2014 email included a repository that caught my eye, [StylishThemes/GitHub-Dark][2]. Apparently one of the people I follow on GitHub starred it, which is awesome. I may not have found this otherwise.

Dark GitHub requires that you have the Stylish extension installed for your browser. Stylish can be easily installed in [Google Chrome][3] or [Mozilla Firefox][4].

So, before you go any further, make sure you have the Stylish extension installed. Click [here for Stylish for Google Chrome][3], and [click here for Stylish for Mozilla Firefox][4]. Stylish is a very useful tool for changing the style of websites, they have an extensive repository of styles that you can apply to your favorite websites. As of this post, they have [custom styles for 59,197 websites][5]. Stylish is powered by [userstyles.org][6].

The Dark GitHub userstyle comes with a variety of syntax highlighting themes, the ability to set your own background image, setting a base color scheme, and changing the code tab size (defaults to 4).

</div>

To install Dark GitHub, visit the [GitHub-Dark userstyles.org page][7]. Select your options (ie: syntax highlighting theme, background image, etc). I typically just leave everything at their defaults.

Once you&#8217;ve got the options set how you want, click the green **Install With Stylish** button, as seen in the image above. You&#8217;ll be asked if you&#8217;re really sure that you want to proceed with installing the GitHub Dark userstyle. If you do want to install it, just click **OK**.

Now [visit GitHub][8] and enjoy the dark colors! `:)`
