Do you use [Ultimate Tag Warrior][1] WordPress plugin to tag your posts? What about the [Google Sitemaps plugin][2] for sending google a copy of your sitemap?

If you use Ultimate Tag Warrior, as I do, you can get archive pages based off tags. For example, my [wordpress tag page][3] shows all posts tagged with &#8220;wordpress&#8221;. Simple enough.

Now, the Google Sitemaps plugin generates a sitemap of your site for submission to [Google Sitemaps][4]. The plugin will include categories, individual posts, static pages, and archives in the sitemap file it creates. However, it leaves out tag archives. This is simply due to the fact that the Google Sitemaps plugin author probably doesn&#8217;t use Ultimate Tag Warrior.

There&#8217;s some good information contained within tag archive pages, so we should probably be letting google know about them. We basically need to make the Google Sitemaps plugin recognize and make use of the tag archives. To do this, we need the [Google Sitemaps &#8211; UltimateTagWarrior Tag Addon][5], a plugin for WordPress. Here&#8217;s the plugin description:

> This plugin is a WordPress 2.0.4 plugin that automatically adds the UltimateTagWarrior tags onto the end of the google sitemap XML file as produced by the Google Sitemap plugin.

The plugin does exactly that, and nothing more. It simply generates a sitemap for your tag pages and appends that data to the end of the sitemap file created by the Google Sitemaps plugin. That&#8217;s all that&#8217;s required to include your tag pages in your sitemap file for sending to Google.

Please note that the Google Sitemaps &#8211; UltimateTagWarrior Tag Addon plugin requires version 2.0.4 of WordPress. Hopefully the author will update the plugin to support the upcoming WordPress 2.0.5.
