## Just got an achievement in QuitNow Pro for Android for 800 cigarettes not smoked {.subtitle}

It&#8217;s actually been over a month now, 40 days to be more precise.

I&#8217;ve finally stopped using my nicotine patches and don&#8217;t miss them. I simply forgot to put a new one on one day. I realized in the evening that I never changed my patch. Took it off but never put a new one on, just because I don&#8217;t really feel the need to.

I&#8217;m still around lots of folks who smoke, but it doesn&#8217;t really bother me like I thought it would.

Hoping the following weeks and months are as smooth as this last week has been. We bought a house on contract, so, having a cigarette did go through my head a few times. Not the least stressful of things to do while stopping smoking. Worked out wonderfully, though.
