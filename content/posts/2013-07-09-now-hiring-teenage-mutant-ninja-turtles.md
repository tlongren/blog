While out smoking today, I came across a manhole cover with some stencil street art next to it. Not all that unusual. But the text is what made me laugh. It referenced something that I haven&#8217;t come into contact with in a while, other than TMNT figurines that sit at my coworkers desks.

Most of my coworkers are probably within 5-10 years in age from me, so we all grew up with the same shows, movies, and music. TNMT is one of the things I think at least 90% of my coworkers can identify with, which is fucking awesome, and that&#8217;s one of the many reason that I _love_ my job.

This was on the **North-East corner of Locust St. and E. 2nd Ave**. It&#8217;s in/near the East Village area in Des Moines. Anyway, the text next to the manhole cover reads as follows:

> Now Hiring:
> 
> Teenage Mutant  
> Ninja Turtles
> 
> Apply Inside

I took a few photos with my Nexus 4. They&#8217;re in the gallery below. Gotta view this as [a single post][1] before you can see the gallery though.

I really wanted to open that manhole cover.
