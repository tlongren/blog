Thinking about doing some freelance work for a while, especially now that [kegplan.io is nearing launch][1]. There was just a [thread on HN today][2] about freelancing, or getting a &#8220;real&#8221; job. Getting recurring freelance work can be difficult, but a &#8220;real&#8221; job provides a steady paycheck. And there&#8217;s this [post on Reddit about breaking into the freelance scene][3], which means being able to make a real living from freelancing.

Most suggestions I hear are about starting freelancing are pretty obvious. **Network, network, network**. The most up-voted answer on that Reddit thread starts off &#8220;Network, network, network. It&#8217;s less about what you know, and often more about who you know.&#8221; I think most people over the age of 13 know that, so it&#8217;s really not all that helpful.

Constant networking isn&#8217;t always possible, at least not without major sacrifices (read: family being pissed). If I&#8217;m out networking all the time with friends who have a lot of contacts, friends-of-friends, possible clients, and just committing to making lots of new contacts in general, that leaves little time for family (not to mention other things).

Is it just a natural progression? Like, the longer you&#8217;re in _it_, the more stuff comes your way? If so, that would make the claim of _network, network, network_ a bit misleading, it implies urgency (at least to me). Seems like _network carefully and methodically_ is more apt. Yet, that still brings up issues, like the possibility of not going hard enough and not living up to your potential.

</div>

So maybe there are no real tips that can be given on freelancing, other than to just stick with it.

I closed my LinkedIn account a long time ago, should I open it back up? I do literally no &#8220;online&#8221; networking, all geographical and in-person. I do have an oDesk account, which is 100% complete and I&#8217;ve completed 5 tests. My oDesk account is _entirely_ filled out.

I&#8217;ve been thinking of doing this for a while, but [@daniAWESOME][4] made me [think a lot more][5] about it.
