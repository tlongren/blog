## Use Gmail SMTP Servers for Sending Emails from WordPress

After quite a bit of back and forth between sendmail, postfix, and exim, I&#8217;ve settled on using [msmtp][1] for sending emails from my servers/droplets at [DigitalOcean][2] (affiliate link). 

MSMTP is very lightweight and has the ability to send emails via an existing SMTP server, like Gmail&#8217;s or Yahoo&#8217;s.

To get it working, there&#8217;s a few tricks. I&#8217;ve pieced this together from [this post][3] and [this post][4]. And when on DigitalOcean, there&#8217;s an IPv6 issue that causes major delays in sending the email, which there&#8217;s a fix for at the end of this post.

### 1. Install msmtp

<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">sudo apt-get install msmtp</pre>

### 2. Configure msmtp to use Gmail

Open up `/etc/msmtprc` as root: sudo nano /etc/msmtprc, and add the following, removing whatever else is there: 

<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"># Gmail/Google Apps
account  gmail 
host   smtp.gmail.com 
port   587 
from   example@gmail.com
user   example@gmail.com
password  enter-password-here!
auth   on 
tls   on 
tls_trust_file /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt 
 
# Default account to use
account default : gmail</pre>

You&#8217;ll want to replace the `user` directive with a valid Gmail email address, a Gmail account or a Google Apps email address will work, too. Don&#8217;t forget to change `enter-password-here!` to the actual password for the Gmail account your using.

Save `/etc/msmtprc`.

### 3. Remove Sendmail

Run this: 

<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">sudo apt-get remove sendmail-bin</pre>

### 4. Setup Some Aliases

Lots of software on Linux systems uses the sendmail command. Instead, we&#8217;re using msmtp, so we&#8217;re essentially invoking msmtp when the `sendmail` command is run. 

<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">sudo ln -s /usr/bin/msmtp /usr/sbin/sendmail
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/msmtp /usr/bin/sendmail
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/msmtp /usr/lib/sendmail</pre>

### 5. Tell PHP About msmtp

First, locate your `php.ini` file that&#8217;s being used by Apache. It&#8217;s typically in `/etc/php5/apache2/php.ini`. If that&#8217;s not it, use PHP&#8217;s `phpinfo()` function to find the location of your `php.ini` file.

Find `sendmail_path =` in `php.ini` and replace it with this: 

<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">sendmail_path = "/usr/bin/msmtp -t"</pre>

Now you should be able to send mail using PHP&#8217;s mail() function, which will use the Gmail SMTP server to send emails. Add this to a PHP file and access it through your browser to see if it works: 

<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">&lt;?php
if(mail("receipient@domain.com","A Subject Here","Hi there,nThis email was sent using PHP's mail function."))
print "Email successfully sent";
else
print "An error occured";
?></pre>

### 6. Disable IPv6 If You Experience Slowness

Open up `/etc/gai.conf` like so: 

<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">sudo nano /etc/gai.conf</pre>

Now, look for a line that looks like this: `#precedence ::ffff:0:0/96 100`. Uncomment that line (remove the #) and save `/etc/gai.conf`. An explanation of why this helps can be found in [this comment][5] at the [DigitalOcean article][4].

### All Done

That should be it. If you run into any issues please do leave a comment, I&#8217;ll do my best to help you out. I may have missed a part, so no guarantees this will work for you. It does however work wonderfully on a [DigitalOcean][2] droplet that&#8217;s running Ubuntu 14.04 with a pretty standard LAMP stack.

You should now be able to send email from WordPress on DigitalOcean.
