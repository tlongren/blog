[K2 1.0-RC8][1] has been released. It has support for threaded comments and [child themes][2]. You can also edit the post meta without having to modify any code now. A list of bug fixes can be [found here][3], and below is the full post from the K2 blog:

> This release adds support for Threaded Comments and [Child Themes][2]. Styles have been improved. You can specify where Styles are stored at, activate multiple styles, and edit them in the WordPress Theme Editor. You can also now customize the Post Meta (the line that reads _Published by John Doe&#8230;_) without having to edit any code.

[ad]  
I plan on building the next version of Unwakeable in the next couple weeks and will likely base it off of K2 1.0-RC8.
