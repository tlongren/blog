Most everyone knows that name now. Cindy Sheehan. Her son was killed in Iraq. She has been demanding face time with President Bush so she can ask him some questions. Namely, what did her son die for in Iraq?

Many high profile liberals have swallowed Cindy Sheehan whole. Cindy thinks the MSM is a propoganda tool for the government. Cindy Sheehan is a propoganda tool for democrats and anti-war liberals in general. Now, I&#8217;m not defending the MSM, but they&#8217;re not the ones to blame, neither is Bush. The lady blogs on Michael Moore&#8217;s website for gods sake, do you blame the president for not wanting to sit down with her? I know I sure as hell don&#8217;t.

Personally, if I was president, I&#8217;d give her all the face time she wanted. Just to shut her up. I understand she lost her son in Iraq, it&#8217;s her own fault she doesn&#8217;t understand the reasons for his death. It&#8217;s like she&#8217;s using her son&#8217;s death to push her own agendas and to undercut the war that this country is in.

If more of this type of thing starts happening, we&#8217;re totally fucked in Iraq and in the war on terror in general. Cindy&#8217;s mindset could spread like a cancer among military families. Prompting people to demand their kids/soldiers be sent home.

These people simply don&#8217;t understand what we&#8217;re up against. We&#8217;re not in a situation where we can just bomb strategic areas and get it over with. I truly think we should send more troops to Iraq and the Middle East. This would send a message to the jahidists that we&#8217;re not leaving until it&#8217;s over. A beefed up military prescense wouldn&#8217;t make us look too good in the eyes of the Iraqi people, but so what? We gave them freedom, I think they can handle our troops being there for a few more years.

Cindy Sheehan and the like don&#8217;t realize that we&#8217;re at war with an idea. We&#8217;re not at war with a place. We&#8217;re not at war with a specific group of people (well, maybe we are). The people that propogate these ideas of hatred towards the west need to be stopped, at any cost. If they&#8217;re not, the society we know and love will cease to exist in the near future.

Hyscience has an [awesome post about Sheehan][1]. Other families who have lost family in Iraq are speaking out against her, asking her to please stop what she&#8217;s doing. Demosophist, at The Jawa Report, has some [interesting things to say][2] about anti-war liberals in general. He also asks some good questions about why anti-war liberals pull away from liberals that support the war.

GOP Bloggers [has a letter][3] from the Sheehan family, distancing themselves from Cindy. Right Wing News thinks Cindy [could be turning a profit][4] from all this. They&#8217;re probably right. Blogs for Bush has a [huge post about Cindy Sheehan][5]. If this the first time you&#8217;ve heard of this lady, I suggest you read what they have to say. It summarizes the whole thing pretty damn well.

Oh, and Danny Carlton over at Jacklewis.net has [a letter from a soldier to his mother][6]. His mother was thinking of joining an anti-war protest. That letter should be very eye opening for some people. Danny also has lots of general info on this Cindy Sheehan story.

Other blogs writing about Sheehan include [Captain&#8217;s Quarters][7], [Riehl World View][8], [Wizbang][9], and [Michelle Malkin][10], who has a very extensive post about Cindy. I think Michelle did a great job the other night on the O&#8217;Reilly Factor.
