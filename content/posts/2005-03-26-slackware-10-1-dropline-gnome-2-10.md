So I upgraded this box to [Slackware 10.1][1] today. While I was at it, I installed the new [Dropline Gnome 2.10 Beta][2]. It&#8217;s really nice so far. A few really obvious changes, but it all works very well. I haven&#8217;t really gotten the chance to test it out much yet, but I expect it&#8217;ll go pretty well.

I don&#8217;t know when the developers are planning on coming out with a stable release, but the mailing list has been really busy lately with fixes for this beta release.
