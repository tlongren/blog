As you can obviously tell (providing you&#8217;ve visited before), I&#8217;ve change the look of this site. I couldn&#8217;t deal with the shitty display in Internet Explorer any longer. The navigation menu on the right would get pushed all the way to the bottom of the page under the previous theme. This new theme ([Phoenixtheme][1]) looks much better in IE than the Oxymod theme did. There&#8217;s a few items that don&#8217;t look exactly right in IE, but nothing anybody would really notice. Mostly just differences in spacing in some areas of the page.

Lots of things have been happening for me lately. Work is absolutely crazy. I figured things would start slowing down right about now, I think I &#8220;figured&#8221; too soon. It seems like we&#8217;re always getting something new to setup that will suck up about 2 months of time. That&#8217;s a good thing though.

Ashley and I got a new vehicle. We got a 2004 Buick Rainier CXL AWD from a local dealership. We&#8217;ve had it for a week now and I really like it so far. It&#8217;s got a very nice sound system by default and rides extremely nice. We&#8217;ll get to see how it handles in the snow tomorrow it sounds like. The weather guys around here are predicting about 9 inches or so.

I also bought a real system for the Rainier. The &#8220;real system&#8221; being a 1000 watt JL Audio amp and 1 12&#8243; MTX Thunder 9500. Both were previously owned by a friend, that setup was almost too loud to listen to when he had it in his Focus. I&#8217;ll hopefully get all that installed this weekend.

Oh, and I&#8217;ll hopefully be blogging more now. [Performancing for Firefox][2] should make it much easier no matter where I&#8217;m located. There&#8217;s been so many interesting stories I&#8217;ve wanted to blog lately but haven&#8217;t had a chance. ie: Cheney Hunting, Cartoons in Holland, New Abu Ghraib pics, and of course, Saddam acting all freaky at trial. Good mother fuckin times!
