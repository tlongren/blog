[ad]  
Oh, I decided to ditch Mystique and go with HTML5Press for this site. Figure I might as well use my own theme for a while. 

<div class="wpulike wpulike-default " >
  <div class="wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked">
    <button type="button"
					aria-label="Like Button"
					data-ulike-id="2943"
					data-ulike-nonce="bf66c1e997"
					data-ulike-type="likeThis"
					data-ulike-template="wpulike-default"
					data-ulike-display-likers="0"
					data-ulike-disable-pophover="0"
					class="wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_likethis_2943"></button><span class="count-box"></span>
  </div>
