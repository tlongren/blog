Microsoft says they&#8217;ll keep producing new games for the Xbox console until 2007. Xbox 2 (Xenon) is supposed to come out by the end of this year. I really hope they make it backwards compatible with the Xbox. I wanna play my current Xbox games on the new Xbox.

Supposedly Halo 2.5 is going to ship with the Xenon. I believe I remember hearing it&#8217;ll include more maps and maybe a new weapon or two&#8230;
