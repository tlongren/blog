I so badly wanted to punch New Orleans mayor Nagin in the face the other day. He&#8217;s a total asshat, getting pissed off because Thad Allen warned people not to go back to New Orleans. At least Nagin has enough of a brain to listen to Thad, nevermind Nagin berating Thad for warning the people of New Orleans not to go back.

Supposedly, it&#8217;ll take about 3&#8243; of additional rain in New Orleans to breach the levee system again. Scary, as 3 inches of rain at once isn&#8217;t uncommon even here in Iowa. I&#8217;d expect more than that on the Gulf coast, aside from there being another major hurricane approaching.

[Michelle Malkin][1] has some good links, including one to [Jason Smith][2] (Generation Why). Jason&#8217;s got pictures comparing the evacuation of Houston compared to that of New Orleans.

[PowerPundit][3] has word that Rita is approaching level 5 hurricane status. The [WeatherBlog][4] has the same information. Wasn&#8217;t Rita still a tropical storm yesterday?

Heather, who has written for HurricAid and lives in Houston, [is evacuating her residence][5] tonight. She has contact info for anyone staying in Houston who wants her to publish some information for them. Could be useful once Rita makes landfall.

[The Political Teen][6] has Rita&#8217;s expected track. The stormtrack has been basically the same for a few days now. I think it&#8217;s expected to make landfall slightly more north of their original estimates. In all reality, it could do anything from hitting Mexico to clobbering New Orleans and the rest of the northern gulf coast again. Should make for an interesting next couple of days.

I&#8217;ll be interested to see what level of hurricane this is when it makes landfall. I believe it&#8217;s technically still a level 4 hurricane, but a powerful level 4. Sounds like Katrina. Looks like Katrina.

I hope it doesn&#8217;t hit New Orleans again. Or anywhere in the U.S. If it does, and causes serious damage like Katrina, expect the islamo-nuts to praise Allah for sending Rita to destroy all us dirty kuffars. Just like they did with Katrina. They&#8217;re silly. [claim][7].
