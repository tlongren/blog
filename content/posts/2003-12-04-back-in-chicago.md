I&#8217;ve been in Chicago since last Sunday. We left from Des Moines around 11:00 PM, made it to Chicago by 3:30, got to bed early Monday morning around 6:30.

Since then we&#8217;ve been working on getting the new office setup. The internet connection is supposed to be here tomorrow. We&#8217;re getting a DS3 connection. The server cabinets are all setup and ready to go.

I&#8217;ll post more on dis later.
