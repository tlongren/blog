Oh my god, I don&#8217;t know what to do. Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston broke up. My life is over.

Seriously though, you&#8217;d think the U.S. is falling apart due to their breaking up. Like usual, the news media is putting words in our mouths. Americans are asking &#8220;How could they do this to us?&#8221;. Americans are being left with a feeling of being dumped.

Excuse me, but I don&#8217;t feel that way. I don&#8217;t give a flying fuck. I have a feeling most of the nation feels the way I do. News must be slow this month if this is such a huge story.

If you are upset about this, you need to get a fucking life of your own and stop leeching off others. This article about the break-up is the most sickening I&#8217;ve seen:

According to them, people are wondering how any relationship will last if Brad&#8217;s and Jen&#8217;s didn&#8217;t. I mean come on, Brad is hot. Jen is hot. They gonna sleep around on eachother. Let&#8217;s be real!
