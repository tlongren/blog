Ashley and I are gonna be going to [Almont, Colorado][1] this weekend. We&#8217;re leaving Friday the 15th and will be returning Sunday the 23rd. Her family has annual reunions there, I&#8217;m going along for the ride this time. Actually, I&#8217;ll be the one driving, but you get it. We&#8217;re planning on going white water rafting, which I&#8217;ve never done but am very excited to try.

I lost my old Teva sandals, which I was pissed about for weeks. I would go through every box in my closet looking for them on a weekly basis. Never found em. I wonder if I left them somewhere. It&#8217;s OK now though cuz [I bought some more][2] yesterday. They should arrive tomorrow or Wednesday. I also [got Ashley a pair][3].

I had been looking for an iPod to take along with us. I couldn&#8217;t spend $350 on one though right before our trip. Had I had that idea a month ago I&#8217;d have one by now. It&#8217;s gonna kill me not having any tunes. Our cabin&#8217;s don&#8217;t even have television.

I fear I may end up having to rent a car for the trip. [Enterprise][4] says I can rent one of theirs for a total of $209. For the entire trip. That seems kinda cheap considering gasoline prices these days.

We aren&#8217;t leaving for a couple days yet but I just wanted to give you all a heads up. This blog will be totally inactive while I&#8217;m gone unless I&#8217;m somehow able to get internet access. I don&#8217;t know who else would want to blog here. I&#8217;m gonna take lots of pictures while I&#8217;m there. I&#8217;ll have some goodies to show when I get back.

**UPDATE:** I take it back, I don&#8217;t have Teva&#8217;s on the way. [RidgeBound][5], the store I bought from, isn&#8217;t open yet. Their site is up just for testing. They just sent me an e-mail saying the refunded my money and they hope to be officially open soon. Sucky cuz it&#8217;s a [kick ass outdoor store][5] that accepts [PayPal][6].
