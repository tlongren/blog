[This is pretty cool][1] ([via Download Squad][2]). It&#8217;s a [Google Maps][3] mashup that integrates videos from [YouTube][4]. Pretty entertaining, and it&#8217;s also been used for educational purposes&#8230;

Here&#8217;s a little about why the site was initially created:

> This site is dedicated to the advancement of distance education, or distance learning, which is a field of education that focuses on the pedagogy/andragogy, technology, and instructional systems design that is effectively incorporated in delivering education to students who are not physically &#8220;on site&#8221; to receive their education. Instead, teachers and students may communicate asynchronously (at times of their own choosing) by exchanging printed or electronic media, or through technology that allows them to communicate in real time (synchronously).
