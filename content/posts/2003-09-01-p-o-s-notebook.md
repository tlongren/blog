It looks like my notebook is dying again. I was working today and all of a sudden, the display started flashing. Then the brightness went really dark. It&#8217;s OK if I reboot, but as soon as Windows has been running for a minute or two it does the same thing. It even happens in Linux, so this tells me it&#8217;s a hardware issue. Lucky me.

I shook it around a bit when this happened and the display actually came back. Before it came totally back though, the tint of the display turned a dark red, then slowly faded back to the normal color. Again, after a few minutes, the display just goes out again. I suppose I&#8217;ll give Sony a call tonight, but I doubt they&#8217;re going to be very helpful since my warranty was up last month.
