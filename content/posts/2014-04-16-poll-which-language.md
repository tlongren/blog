## Just an unscientific poll of [Hacker News][1] and [Designer News][2] users (mostly) {.subtitle}

<div id="polls-28" class="wp-polls">
</div>

<div id="polls-28-loading" class="wp-polls-loading">
  <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.longren.io/wp-content/plugins/wp-polls/images/loading.gif?resize=16%2C16&#038;ssl=1" width="16" height="16" alt="Loading ..." title="Loading ..." class="wp-polls-image" data-recalc-dims="1" />&nbsp;Loading ...
</div>

Results will always be publicly available. This is more of a practice simply to help me gauge where I should go from PHP and JavaScript. [Golang is enticing][3] and is currently what I&#8217;m leaning towards.

[Hacker News][4] thread, and [Designer News][5] thread.

  <div class="wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked">
