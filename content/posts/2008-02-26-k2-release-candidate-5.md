[K2][1] [release candidate 3][2] was released a little over four months ago. Today, as I was going through all my feeds, I saw there were some commits to the K2 SVN. The log for [one of the commits][3] stated that the version for K2 has been bumped up to release candidate 5. Here&#8217;s a piece from the commit:

> Author: Heilemann  
> Date: Mon Feb 25 22:57:53 2008  
> New Revision: 636
> 
> Modified:  
> trunk/style.css
> 
> Log:  
> Upped version to RC5. Preparing release.

This is rather exciting for me, especially the &#8220;preparing release&#8221; portion of that. I&#8217;m hoping &#8220;preparing release&#8221; means they&#8217;re getting ready to drop K2 1.0 as opposed to getting ready to release a download for K2 release candidate 5. As you probably know, [Unwakeable][4] is based on K2. Once K2 1.0 is out, I&#8217;ll start building [Unwakeable 2.0][5].
