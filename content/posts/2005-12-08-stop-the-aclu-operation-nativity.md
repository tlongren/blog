Every year we watch as the [secularization of the birth of Christ][2] happens around us. This year people are being preemptive, and its been quite successful. Kevin McCullough has started a campaign [to send the ACLU Merry Christmas cards][3]. Another effort is out there as well called Operation Nativity.

> Dr. Charles Nestor, director of [The Truth Matters][4], is announcing a project called &#8220;Operation Nativity&#8221; with the goal of having Christians across the country set up nativity scenes on their own property.
> 
> Nestor states, &#8220;It&#8217;s that time of year again. We&#8217;re not even out of October and already the forces are aligning to prohibit the public celebration of the birth of Jesus.
> 
> &#8220;December 25 is the day in our culture that is set aside to acknowledge and to celebrate that Jesus of Nazareth was born. For Christians it is more than a day of feasting and the exchange of gifts, it is a holy and solemn time to join our voices in unison as the angels proclaimed on the hillside to the shepherds, &#8216;Glory to God in the highest.&#8217;
> 
> &#8220;I am calling for Christians everywhere to join me in Operation Nativity. While we continue to support the public displays, let&#8217;s flood the country with nativity scenes on our own properties!
> 
> &#8220;Think with me what could happen if on lawns in every community, on business property, on church lawns, at Christian schools, on empty land, and literally everywhere you looked, there was the depiction of the scene that recognizes the birth of Jesus.
> 
> &#8220;[Simple cutouts are available][5]. Many already own lighted sets. It could be a family project, filled with opportunities to teach children about the events surrounding the birth of the Savior.[Source][6]

We are all for this, and encourage everyone to join in this expression of Christmas. And we want to take this idea and run with it! Decorate your blog for Christmas with a nativity scene, in support of religious expression, and as a sign of your support for stopping the ACLU. The ACLU will be busy this Christmas season, lets be prepared.

Please download the pics, and host them yourself&#8230;I can not afford the bandwidth of hotlinking. If you want to put the nativity scene pic in support of Stop The ACLU, and to decorate your blog for the Christmas season, copy the code below, and replace the URL of the pics with the downloaded pic that you host.
