[This article at Yoast][1] convinced me to update my permalink structure here at longren.org to something a bit more simple.

Previously, I was using a permalink structure like <http://www.longren.org/2011/05/26/html5press-1-5/>. This is how it was setup in the WordPress permalinks settings:

<pre>/%year%/%monthnum%/%day%/%postname%/</pre>

The new permalink structure is:

<pre>/%postname%/</pre>

That will produce URL&#8217;s like <http://www.longren.org/html5press-1-5/>.

That change will make for shorter URL&#8217;s, and will no longer show the date in the URL.

I also added this bit to my .htaccess file:

<pre>RedirectMatch 301 /d{4}/d{2}/d{2}/(.*) http://www.longren.org/$1</pre>

That tells browsers requesting an old URL where the new one is located. It does so by issuing a 301 redirect, which tells browsers the URL has permanently moved. 301 redirects are search engine friendly too. 

<div class="wpulike wpulike-default " >
  <div class="wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked">
    <button type="button"
					aria-label="Like Button"
					data-ulike-id="2869"
					data-ulike-nonce="c0aebfdc77"
					data-ulike-type="likeThis"
					data-ulike-template="wpulike-default"
					data-ulike-display-likers="0"
					data-ulike-disable-pophover="0"
					class="wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_likethis_2869"></button><span class="count-box"></span>
  </div>
