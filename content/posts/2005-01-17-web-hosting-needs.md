I&#8217;m not very active in the development of [www.djpi.net][1] anymore but the site is in need of a new host again. I got a few months of free hosting for the site from one of my previous employers.

If anyone here knows where I can obtain free hosting that includes PHP, MySQL, Apache, and prefferably ssh access. I&#8217;ve contacted a few places already, none seem too willing to donate, understandingly.

I would host it here if I had more bandwidth, but I don&#8217;t. I barely have enough for this site. DJ Pi&#8217;s site goes through a decent ammount of bandwidth in a month and gets a good number of hits. So, if you can provide or know where I can obtain these services, please let me know!

Thanks!
