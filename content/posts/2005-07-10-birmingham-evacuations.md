I heard earlier on FoxNews that the city center of Birmingham was being evacuated due to a &#8220;substantial threat&#8221; to public safety. Only two days after the london bombings took place, on the 7th. [Clarity & Resolve][1] [mentions &#8220;controlled explosions&#8221;][2] being reported. [Bongo Vongo][3] says that a suspicious package was found on a bus. That package was detonated by police. 

[The Jawa Report][4] also has [quite a bit of detail][5] on this. [Jeff Quniton][6] has a couple updates and a [lot][7] [of][8] [links][9] to news sites and [blogs covering][10] the evacuation. He&#8217;s also [got a press release][11] [from the police][12].

Here&#8217;s some of what the [BBC][9] had to say.

> West Midlands Police said people were being asked to leave the centre, particularly Broad Street, as a &#8220;precautionary measure&#8221;.
> 
> No vehicles are being allowed past the inner ring road into the city centre, and there have also been reports of controlled explosions by police.
> 
> Police said it was in response to intelligence the force had received. &#8230;
> 
> West Midlands Police announced they had received intelligence of a possible threat to the area around 2015BST.
> 
> Initially people were told to be on their guard and that bars and restaurants were being searched. Motorists were also told not to come into the city centre.
> 
> Around 2100BST the police announced that the city was to be evacuated.
