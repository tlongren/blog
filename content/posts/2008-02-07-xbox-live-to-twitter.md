[Duncan Mackenzie][1] released [an application][2] in May of 2007 that checks your Xbox Live status and sends your status to [Twitter][3] so all your followers on Twitter can see what you&#8217;re playing on your Xbox 360.  
<!--adsense-->

  
A short while after the initial release, Microsoft made some changes to Xbox Live that broke Duncan&#8217;s software, so he came out with [an update][4]. Then, a short while later, both Xbox Live and Twitter made some changes which totally broke Duncan&#8217;s software. It hasn&#8217;t worked since those updates were made.

Since then, I&#8217;ve been looking for something similar every few weeks or so. The other day, I set out to find a replacement for Duncan&#8217;s software and I came across [Martin Hinshelwood&#8217;s blog][5].

Martin has picked up where Duncan left off with his [Xbox Live to Twitter][6] application. Martin was having trouble getting Duncan&#8217;s software to work, so he just wrote his own. I&#8217;ve been using Martin&#8217;s Xbox Live to Twitter app for a few days now and haven&#8217;t had any problems with it. It&#8217;s been posting [my Xbox Live status][7] to Twitter like mad.

If you use Twitter and have Xbox Live, you should give [Xbox Live to Twitter][6] a try. You can [download the Windows installer][8] or the [source code][9] at the CodePlex.
