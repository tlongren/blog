WordPress Multi-user 1.0 has been released. WordPress MU is designed for hosting and managing hundreds or thousands of blogs, similar to [WordPress.com][1]. Setup of WordPress MU is considerably more difficult than setting up a stand-alone WordPress installation. Here&#8217;s some text from the post to the [WordPress development blog][2]:

> WordPress MU is an official branch of WordPress that is designed for managing and hosting thousands of blogs instead of just one. Itâ€™s the software that powers WordPress.com, for example. MU has been in heavy development for about a year now, and weâ€™ve finally polished it up to a place where we feel like itâ€™s ready for public consumption. Since setup is a bit more complex than the 5-minute install of regular WordPress, MU is best suited for a more server-savvy audience. You can [download it on the WordPress MU site][3].

[bbPress 0.72][4] was also released. bbPress is a piece of forum software &#8220;with the WordPress touch&#8221;.

Head on over to the [WordPress Development blog][2] for more info on both of these products.

On a related note, WordPress 2.0.5 is still due out soon. Lorelle has [a post in which she goes over a few of the changes][5] we can expect in WordPress 2.0.5. Go [check it out][5].
