Really wasn&#8217;t expecting [this, but I&#8217;ll take it][1]. [Giganews][2], a premium usenet provider, is increasing their retention on binary newsgroups from 70 days to 90 days. Here&#8217;s part of the announcement from the Giganews website:

> Giganews, Inc. announced today a storage increase for single and multi-part binary newsgroups. Over the next few weeks retention in these newsgroups will start to grow to an unprecedented 90 days. Giganewsâ€™ current binary newsgroup retention of 70 days will increase day by day as the additional storage starts to fill with new articles.

<!--adsense-->

  
Giganews has to be one of the first, if not _the_ first company to provide binary retention greater than 70 days. 90 day binary retention is pretty much unheard of. Lots of usenet providers don&#8217;t even have 90 day text retention. That&#8217;s why Giganews is the best though. Currently, their retention for text newsgroups is around 1,150 days.

So, if you&#8217;re looking for or are interested in a premium usenet service, I&#8217;d [suggest Giganews][2]. I&#8217;ve been a customer of theirs for a little over one year now. The service has been totally transparent for me, it works all the time and I always max out my downstream bandwidth. ðŸ™‚
