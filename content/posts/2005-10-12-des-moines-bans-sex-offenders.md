Mike Pechar has a post at [Conservative Thinking][1] (also at [Interested-Participant][2]) speaking of towns banning sexual offenders. I had heard a little talk of this lately, but didn&#8217;t realize it was basically going on in my backyard.

The city of Des Moines is banning sex offenders from living within the city. Enforcement of the ordinance in Des Moines is set to begin this month. It makes me very happy to see this happening in Des Moines, instead of halfway across the country like is usually the case.

Finally, the nation has a reason other than primaries to watch Iowa. Head on over to [Conservative Thinking][1] and have a look.

It&#8217;s highly odd that I didn&#8217;t know about this going on in Des Moines. It&#8217;s sad that bloggers not even living in this state are able to inform me of this before my local media does. Mike Pechar (and Chris Short too) are obviously on-top of things a lot more than I am. The [Des Moines Register][3] has an article.
