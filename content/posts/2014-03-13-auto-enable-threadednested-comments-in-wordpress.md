## Threaded comments let people reply to each other {.subtitle}

In theme or functionality plugin

You can auto-enable nested comments in your theme&#8217;s **functions.php** file or [in your functionality plugin][1]. Just use the code below.

<pre class="lang:php decode:true " >function enable_threaded_comments(){
 if (!is_admin()) {
  if (is_singular() AND comments_open() AND (get_option('thread_comments') == 1))
   wp_enqueue_script('comment-reply');
  }
}
add_action('get_header', 'enable_threaded_comments');</pre>

That&#8217;s all there is to it. Threaded/nested comments will automatically be enabled, so you won&#8217;t have to turn them on in the WordPress Dashboard [like you normally would][2]. 

<div class="wpulike wpulike-default " >
  <div class="wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked">
    <button type="button"
					aria-label="Like Button"
					data-ulike-id="5963"
					data-ulike-nonce="9b71422241"
					data-ulike-type="likeThis"
					data-ulike-template="wpulike-default"
					data-ulike-display-likers="0"
					data-ulike-disable-pophover="0"
					class="wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_likethis_5963"></button><span class="count-box"></span>
  </div>
