More ads are coming to MSN messenger. The link above is just one of many existing. I never use the official client soley because of the ads. There was already ads at the bottom all the time. I use [Gaim][1] all the time. It&#8217;s got support for about every popular IM system.

File transfers didn&#8217;t work too well I tried them with Gaim and MSN, but they work well with AIM and Yahoo! Messenger. I haven&#8217;t done any file transfers in a while though on MSN with Gaim, I imagine it&#8217;s prolly been fixed by now. There&#8217;s even a [windows build of Gaim][2]!
