I really like the new [RSS &#8220;clips&#8221;][1] found in [Gmail][2]. I added the Yahoo News most e-mailed feed and saw something about [gay cowboys][3] in a movie called &#8220;[Brokeback Mountain][4]&#8220;.  
<!--adsense-->

  
In &#8220;Brokeback Mountain&#8221;, two cowboys fall in love. OK, thats pretty far from the norm, but I can deal with that. The part that creeps me out is they &#8220;fall in love while wrangling sheep in Wyoming in 1963.&#8221;

> Based on an Annie Proulx&#8217;s short story, &#8220;Brokeback Mountain&#8221; is about two cowboys who meet and fall in love while wrangling sheep in Wyoming in 1963. Their love lasts through two decades as they each get married to women and live &#8220;normal&#8221; lives.
> 
> &#8220;Moving and majestic,&#8221; said The New York Times; &#8220;An American masterpiece&#8221; said the New York Observer; &#8220;Unmissable and unforgettable&#8221; said Rolling Stone.

To answer that last question, probably, but should we have to be ready? It just seems like such an obvious attempt to generate hype. But that&#8217;s OK, I can&#8217;t get past the whole sheep rancher thing. There couldn&#8217;t have been a lot to do back then other than fuck some sheep and maybe even a dude here and there.

The story line sounds like it would make a better animated show on Comedy Central or Adult Swim than it does a movie.
