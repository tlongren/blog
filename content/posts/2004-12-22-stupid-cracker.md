You gotta read that. This guy is funny as hell. He&#8217;s also a jack ass. The accusations against VA Systems and Slashdot, also hilarious. Anyway, he&#8217;s supposedly some kind of prophet, named SOLLOG. [Wikipedia][1] gave both sides of his story, which he didn&#8217;t like. Someone contributing to the Wikipedia page about him called his prophecies into question.

He started [www.wikipediasucks.com][2], the mature dude that he is. Notice all the links at the top of the page? &#8220;1 News &#8211; 1 Search &#8211; 1 For Sale&#8221; blah, blah, blah. Anyway, same links on the 247news.net website. It&#8217;s pretty obvious he owns the 247news.net site too. He&#8217;s writing news about himself as if it&#8217;s not him? That&#8217;s creepy.

But yah, the whole thing is pretty funny. He&#8217;s upset that people on [Slashdot][3] were makin fun of him. I think it&#8217;s great how the wikipediasucks.com site makes it seem like being a porn producer a bad thing. &#8220;Jimbo&#8221; Wales should be given a medal.
