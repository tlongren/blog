Patrick, the dirty kuffar behind Clarity and Resolve, has [a new look][1] for the website. I think it looks a whole lot better. I like the lighter color. The amount of graphics has been reduced too, which makes for a much quiker loading page. It&#8217;ll probably save him some bandwidth too. It&#8217;s got a more minimalistic look to it than the previous design. I love it.

Also, James Joyner, over at [Outside The Beltway][2], is getting married tonight. Best of luck to him and his new wife. I guess this will end up in the &#8220;Beltway Wedding Jam&#8221;.

Since we&#8217;re on the topic of weddings, Barry Schwartz of [Search Engine Roundtable][3] recently proposed to his girl via Ask Jeeves search. He brought Yisha (fiance) to his office and asked her to search for her name. Upon doing so the search results returned a small image and text asking the question. You can see more by searching Ask Jeeves for &#8220;[rustybrick engagement][4]&#8220;. Very nice Barry.
