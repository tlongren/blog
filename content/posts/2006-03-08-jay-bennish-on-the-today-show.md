Jay Bennish got a hell of a make-over for his Today Show appearance yesterday. [Michelle Malkin][1] has a before and after picture. He doesn&#8217;t have that hippie look so much anymore. Now he&#8217;s just sportin a little weasel look.

Matt Lauer likes Jay Bennish a whole lot it would seem. He pretty much started off the interview on the defense for Bennish. Ian at [Expose the Left][2] can explain:

> Lauer began the interview by TELLING the audience that Bennish was taken out of context. I guess we didnâ€™t hear the great reason Bennish had for comparing President Bush to Adolf Hitler, please do tell us Matt. But wait, Bennish did give us a reason. How was it taken out of context, I donâ€™t know.

If you wanna see the video, visit Expose the Left at the link above. They&#8217;ve also got [a video and post][3] of a student responding to Jay Bennish appearing on The Today Show.  
<!--adsense#ypn-->

  
Bennish was pretty stuck on the point that he was only bashing the U.S. for 20 minutes out of a 50 minute class. The other 30 minutes must be dedicated to praising the U.S.? Curt at [Flopping Aces][4] doesn&#8217;t think so.

[Slapstick Politics][5] is continuing their piece &#8221; Indoctrination Not Education In The Classroom&#8221;, now at part 3. This Bennish guy just makes me angry, like that Cindy Sheehan lady, who got arrested again the other day. Let&#8217;s hope Bennish doesn&#8217;t follow in the footsteps of his might-be role-model.

This post is linked at [Mudville Gazette][6], they&#8217;ve got another open post. Some good stuff there, how typical.
