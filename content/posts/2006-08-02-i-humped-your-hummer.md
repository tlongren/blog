[Humping Hummers][1], sounds fun right? It sure looks fun too! These crazy kids go around town humping hummers, just for fun and amusement. Bet they&#8217;ll stop when they get caught humping the wrong persons Hummer. I&#8217;d kill em if I owned a Hummer and someone was humping mine.

Still, engaging in Hummer Humping would probably be quite fun on an otherwise boring day.

> Since the Hummer was made available commercially for civilian use in the early 1990s, it has increased dramatically in popularity, attracting such diverse constituencies as: soccer moms, drug dealers, and professional athletes and other celebrities. You may well ask, “Where do I fit into this mix?” It’s a fair question to pose, and one that we hope to satisfy here. For those of us who cannot or do not care to own a Hummer, there is still a fun and easy way to be a part of this craze.
> 
> The act of humping a Hummer and videotaping it can be interpreted in a variety of ways—it can be seen as a political statement, a piece of performance art, an opportunity to satisfy a roaring libido, or a an amusing activity to engage in as you’re walking down the street. Whatever your motivation, this website serves as a friendly forum to share your experiences humping Hummers. Whether it’s submitting your own Hummer humping videos, sharing a sighting, or passing on a bit of Hummer-related news, we hope you will see this site as a resource and a place to exchange your Hummer encounters.
