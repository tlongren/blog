I got another HP Vectra XW machine working. I thought it had totally crapped out on me a few months ago, but it turns out it was just the video card. So I got another dual PPro 200 running now. All it does is crunch seti@home.

The power has been going off quite a bit here. So, once again, my uptimes aren&#8217;t very good. I&#8217;ll have to take my machines down again when I move, so I probably won&#8217;t get my uptimes very high in the next few weeks.

Also, the extraction of my teeth went pretty well. They gave me laughing gas, I thought it was pretty funny when they put the IV in my, and before I knew it I was zonked out. I woke up in a different room. My mouth is still bleeding pretty good. It&#8217;s kind of hard for me to sleep since I&#8217;ve bee sleeping most of the day. I suppose I&#8217;ll try to go to sleep now.
