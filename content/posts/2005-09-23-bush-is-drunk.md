Not really, but the [National Enquirer][1] says he&#8217;s started drinking again. &#8220;Bush Drinking&#8221; is one of the top searches on Technorati currently. One of the few blogs I can find actually writing about the subject is [Immigration Watchdog][2].

Not sure why Bush drinking is a big deal, people have been serving drunk probably since this country was founded. I&#8217;d be able to identify more with Bush if he did have a nip every now and then. I doubt wether he actually started drinking again, it&#8217;s the freakin National Enquirer.

Brian Flemming has [word of this][3] too. He&#8217;s got [a related post][4] about Bush&#8217;s bathroom note debating what he was drinking in a glass he&#8217;s holding in a photo. None of it makes any sense to me.
