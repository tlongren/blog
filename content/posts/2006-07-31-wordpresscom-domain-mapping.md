[WordPress.com][1], the free blog hosting site based off [WordPress][2], is getting ready to allow users to use their own domain names in conjunction with the wordpress.com service. What&#8217;s that mean? You will be able to setup a domain to point to your wordpress.com blog.

For example, I blog at [http://slackware.wordpress.com][3]. If I bought the slackwareblog.com domain, I could point it to slackware.wordpress.com. So, slackwareblog.com would essentially be running on top of WordPress.com. It&#8217;s a lot like [gmail for your domain][4].

Right now, WordPress.com is only testing this feature out, [offering it to the first 8 people to comment on the WordPress.com blog post][5] discussing the new feature. I&#8217;ve been wishing for this feature since I started using wordpress.com, glad it&#8217;s finally on the horizon.

[On a related note][6], &#8220;92.63% of the traffic to WordPress.com is for blogs outside of the top 25.&#8221; I figured it&#8217;d be lower than that, but that&#8217;s pretty impressive for those outside the top 25.
