Ben Domenech has had a rough few days. He [started off][1] taking shit for his new [Red America][2] blog over at WaPo. Then he&#8217;s [called a bigot][3] for some blog posts he made a while back at [Red State][4].

Now, he&#8217;s been [forced to resign][5] from his position at WaPo due to plagiarism charges (also posted at [official WaPo Blog][6]). It was probably a good idea for him to step down. Lots of people from both sides wanted to see him go.

Jim Brady posted at Red America announcing Ben&#8217;s resignation. Jim is the executive editor at washingtonpost.com. Below are conservative bloggers with some rather interesting things to say about Domenech:  
[Riehl World View][7]  
[The Political Pit Bull][8]  
[Outside The Beltway][9]  
[Michelle Malkin][10]  
[Don Surber][11]  
[Right Wing Nut House][12]  
[Iowa Voice][13]

All-in-all, this sucks. Had there not been such a huge initial furor over Ben and WaPo, Red America would still be around. I understand peoples anger about Ben though. He did plagiarize, losing Red America are the consequences of his actions. Too bad.
