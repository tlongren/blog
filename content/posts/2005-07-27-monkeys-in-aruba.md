Red, the only [Scared Monkey][1] I&#8217;ve had a conversation with, is [going to Aruba][2] to assist in searching for Natalee and will also be reporting live.

I haven&#8217;t really written much about Natalee Holloway, I guess it never really interested me. Lastnight though, I flipped over to Fox News for a bit and of course they were covering the story. At the time, there was a camera crew watching some guys [drain a pond in Aruba][3]. It had to be around midnight in Aruba at the time. I couldn&#8217;t stop watching that. Obviously they had a pretty good clue something was down there as they wouldn&#8217;t have bothered to drain the pond if there wasn&#8217;t. Especially at that time of night. It looks like [this guy knew about][4] the pond being drained before FoxNews even did. Way to go!

Hyscience is reporting that Natalee [could possibly in Venezuela][5]. I could believe that as it&#8217;s not too far from Aruba and the rest of the Netherland Antilles (50 to 100 miles maybe?). They&#8217;ve got a whole bunch of links to related items, lots of those links going to Scared Monkeys.

I just can&#8217;t believe how much Scared Monkeys has grown. I started reading them a couple months before the Natalee Holloway thing started. Their site is now being cited in [major publications][6] and Red or Tom even appeared on Fox News once I think&#8230;

I linked once above, but Dan at Riehl World View says Jug Twitty (Natalee&#8217;s step-father) thinks this is going to be [a big week in the investigation][7]. I&#8217;d say so as the FBI now has a bigger say in the investigation.
