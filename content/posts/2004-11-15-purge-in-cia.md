This almost scares me. It seems that President Bush is going to purge the CIA of officers suspected of somehow being disloyal to him. Also, the purge will target officers who supposedly leaked damaging information to the media about U.S. conduct in the Iraq war. All of this is from &#8220;knowledgeable sources&#8221;. This is all over the good blogs, but here&#8217;s the original article:

I feel more and more like we&#8217;re living in a communist state. This immediately made me think of the old soviet empire. Dirty, dirty, dirty.
