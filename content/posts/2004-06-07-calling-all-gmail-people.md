If ANYONE has any Gmail invites left, I&#8217;d be very interested in trading you some trance mixes for an invite. I almost got my hands on an invite lastnight, but the guy that I sent a couple sets to had already sent out his 2 invites (one to his girlfriend and the other got auctioned off on Ebay). If he gets some more, he said he&#8217;ll send me one, but I&#8217;m not counting on him getting anymore invites anytime soon.

So, if you wanna help me get a Gmail account, let me know.
