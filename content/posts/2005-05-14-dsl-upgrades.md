My old ISP, [MidIowa Net][1] is upgrading our DSL line @ work. They called me yesterday to tell us. That rocks so much because right now, our max download is around 25Kb/s. Max upload is about the same.

Anyway, they said they&#8217;re upgrading us to a full dsl line on the 25th. We&#8217;re getting a new modem and everything. MidIowa Net is the ISP my family used when I was in high school. Back then they only provided dial-up. They&#8217;re a pretty small local ISP serving a bunch of small towns in Iowa.

The best thing about it is they&#8217;re upgrading us for free. We barely pay anything for our DSL anyway&#8230;
