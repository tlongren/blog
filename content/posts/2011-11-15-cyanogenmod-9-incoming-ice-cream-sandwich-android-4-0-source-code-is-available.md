The source code for Ice Cream Sandwich (Android 4.0) is [now available][1]. You can find [instructions for downloading the source][2] at the [Android Open Source Project site][3].

[Steve Kondik][4], the original creator of Cyanogenmod, tweeted the following last night:  
[blackbirdpie url=&#8221;https://twitter.com/#!/cyanogen/status/136313427248431104&#8243;]

Sounds like we&#8217;ll start seeing the first Cyanogenmod 9 builds in the next couple months! Exciting news for everyone who has been abandoned by their handset manufacturer. I highly doubt my Motorola Defy will ever see an official upgrade, even to Gingerbread. Ice Cream Sandwich should run quite well on the Defy&#8217;s hardware.

This is exciting news for everyone in the Android community really, not just those who&#8217;ve been abandoned. The more choices you have the better, and Cyanogenmod is available for a multitude of devices.

Can&#8217;t wait until the nightly builds start popping up, it&#8217;s gonna be a fun next couple of months! If I had to guess, I&#8217;d say we&#8217;ll see an alpha or the first nightly builds of Cyanogenmod 9 within a month, or a little more. Hopefully by Christmas (and this is just me wishing) we&#8217;ll have something!

[Steve][5] also mentioned on Twitter that work will progress on Cyanogenmod 7.2 until it&#8217;s ready to be released, while simultaneously working on Cyanogenmod 9.

If you&#8217;d like to get the Ice Cream Sandwich look now and not wait until Cyanogenmod 9 is out, have a look at my post [Make Cyanogenmod 7.1 Look Like Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich (Kinda)][6].
