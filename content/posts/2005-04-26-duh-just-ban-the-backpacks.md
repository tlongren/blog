A school board or some school administration entity banned backpacks at a highschool. I think they saw it as the only way to stop bomb threats. Aren&#8217;t most bomb threats made via phone or some other means of communication? I had no idea backpacks could be used as a communications device.

The funniest thing is, the ban isn&#8217;t enforced after school. So there&#8217;s kids carrying sports bags and purses inside after school. It&#8217;s funny because they think banning backpacks will actually help solve a problem. If they&#8217;re gonna make a stupid ass policy like this, then they need to at least enforce it 100% of the time. That would mean no bags of any kind at any time. Stupid, stupid people.
