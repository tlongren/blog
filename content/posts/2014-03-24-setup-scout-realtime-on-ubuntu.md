I love server monitoring. It&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve always liked. When I discovered `top` in about 1998 on Slackware Linux, I fell in love.

Top is old, though. [Scout Realtime][1] isn&#8217;t.

Scout Realtime is built with Ruby and can be installed as a Ruby gem. Make sure you&#8217;ve got **rubygems** installed. If it&#8217;s not installed, then install it.

Scout Realtime doesn&#8217;t work with Ruby 1.8, it requires Ruby 1.9. Installing Ruby 1.9 is [pretty easy and is explained in detail in this post][2].

## Install Scout Realtime

This has been tested on Ubuntu 13.10 on a [DigitalOcean VPS][3]. 

Now you can install Scout Realtime:  
<span class="lang:sh decode:true  crayon-inline " >sudo gem install scout_realtime</span>

After it&#8217;s been installed, launch it! You can run it as root or as your normal user. If you want to run it as root, just add `sudo` before the `scout_realtime` command below.  
<span class="lang:sh decode:true  crayon-inline " >scout_realtime</span>

That&#8217;ll start Scout Realtime on it&#8217;s default listening port, which is 5555. If you&#8217;d like it to run on a different port, run `scout_realtime --help` to see how to go about that.

## Access Scout Realtime

There&#8217;s a couple ways that you can access Scout Realtime in your browser.

The quickest and safest way is to setup a [SSH tunnel][4]. This is how [Scout shows Realtime being setup][1].  
<span class="lang:sh decode:true  crayon-inline " >ssh -NL 5555:localhost:5555 user@ip_or_hostname</span> 

Replace `user@ip_or_hostname` with your SSH user and hostname.

Once the SSH tunnel is setup and running, open up your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5555`. You should see Scout Realtime, it&#8217;ll look similar to the screenshot that&#8217;s attached to this post.

You can also open a firewall port, allowing access to port 5555, or whatever port you&#8217;ve got Scout Realtime running on. Doing this will provide you with persistent access to Scout Realtime. Just navigate to your IP address or domain on the relevant port.

That&#8217;s it! Scout Realtime should now be running on your server, and you&#8217;ve got a couple of different options for accessing Scout Realtime.
