Saw this on [Blogs of War][1] via [Slashdot][2]:

> cyclop writes ‚ÄúIn March, U.S. troops in Iraq shot to death [Nicola Calipari][3], the Italian intelligence agent that rescued the kidnapped journalist [Giuliana Sgrena][4]. U.S. commission on the incident produced a report which public version was censored for more than one third. Now Italian press is reporting that all confidential information in the report is available to the public, [just by copying ‚Äúhidden‚Äù text from the PDF and pasting it in a word processor][5] (Italian). The uncensored report [can now be directly downloaded][6] (evil .DOC format, sorry)‚Äù

Sounds like someone is gonna end up in a decent bit of trouble. Can&#8217;t say I&#8217;d want to be the one who let that cat out of the bag.
