Isn&#8217;t [this interesting][1]? Mexico is all ready to launch lawsuits against the U.S. for protecting our own damn border. Why lawsuits? Well, Mexico is [worried about the security and safety][2] of the would-be border jumpers. Kinda ironic huh? I was 100% positive the Mexican government didn&#8217;t give a rats ass about their citizens, guess [I was wrong][3].

> CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico &#8211; Mexico said Tuesday that it would file lawsuits in U.S. courts if National Guard troops on the border become directly involved in detaining migrants.
> 
> Mexican border officials also said they worried that sending troops to heavily trafficked regions would push illegal migrants into more perilous areas of the U.S.-Mexican border to avoid detection.
> 
> President Bush announced Monday that he would send 6,000 National Guard troops to the 2,000-mile border, but they would provide intelligence and surveillance support to Border Patrol agents, not catch and detain illegal immigrants.

Note, lawsuits happen &#8220;if National Guard troops on the border become directly involved in detaining migrants.&#8221; Migrants? Excuse me, but these aren&#8217;t fucking migrants. They&#8217;re illegal immigrants trying to make it to the U.S. for a better life. Sorry, but they&#8217;re criminals.

[Stop The ACLU][7]

On a related note, [Hyscience has a list][8] of Republican Senators that voted with the Democrats on the immigration issue. Someone should probably let them know what a bad decision they made. At least bring it to their attention that they&#8217;re ignoring the will of their constituents, it&#8217;s the courteous thing to do.
