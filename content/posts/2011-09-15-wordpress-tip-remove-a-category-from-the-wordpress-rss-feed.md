I recently setup [The Events Calendar][1] WordPress plugin on a few sites for work. The events are added as posts, so they show up in the WordPress RSS feed.

We didn&#8217;t want events showing in the RSS feed, this is the code I ended up with:

<pre>// Keep events out of RSS
add_filter('pre_get_posts', 'exclude_category_from_feed');
function exclude_category_from_feed($query) {
	if ($query->is_feed) {
		$query->set('cat','-'.get_cat_ID( 'Events' ));
	}
	return $query;
}
</pre>

Adding that bit of code to the functions.php file for your theme will prevent posts in the &#8220;Events&#8221; category from appearing in your RSS feed. You can obviously change &#8220;Events&#8221; to whatever category you want to exclude.  
[ad]  
It can be extended too, not just limited to keeping a category out of the RSS feed. For example, to keep a category off the home page or archive pages, you can change this:

<pre>if ($query->is_feed) {</pre>

To this:

<pre>if ($query->is_archive || $query->is_home) {</pre>

That&#8217;s it! Hope you find it useful.
