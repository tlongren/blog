Saw this on [Slashdot][1] and [Vulturo.com][2] this morning. It seems airport security screeners in the U.S. are getting some new tech. The new X-Ray equipment will allow them to see through peoples clothes. I can&#8217;t imagine this will fly. I mean, they don&#8217;t even let doctors do that kinda stuff. That&#8217;s why they put that big lead vest on you, so they can&#8217;t see your weiner! The sicko airport weirdos wanna see everyone&#8217;s. It&#8217;s disturbing to me that this is being allowed to happen. I hope the privacy nuts freak out and somehow manage to make this not happen.

You can [read the entire thing at C|New news.com][3]. Here&#8217;s [what was said on Slashdot][4] about it.
