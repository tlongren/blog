## I thought it&#8217;d be harder, honestly {.subtitle}

The urge to smoke hasn&#8217;t been as bad as I had expected. Not nearly as bad. I think I&#8217;d like to make it to two months without a cigarette, smoke one, then quit again, just to do it. Not sure [the wife][1] would go for that. In fact, I know she wouldn&#8217;t. `:)`

I&#8217;ve been using [QuitNow Pro for Android][2] to track my progress. It figures out roughly how much money I&#8217;m saving, how many hours of my life I&#8217;ve saved, and the total number of cigarettes I haven&#8217;t smoked that I normally would have smoked. It&#8217;s pretty cool, and there&#8217;s a TON of [stop smoking apps on the Google Play Store][3].

I&#8217;m still using the 21mg nicotine patch, and will probably continue to do so. I toyed with the idea of stepping down to the 14mg patch early, but decided I might as well use what I have and just stick with what&#8217;s working.

    So badly want to attempt a lower dose nicotine patch tomorrow. But probably won't.

At this rate, I don&#8217;t think remaining smoke free will be a problem for me. Yesterday, I had zero urges to go outside for a smoke, which was a first.

In a typical day, I&#8217;d get that urge to go outside to smoke about two or three times, and realized it was mostly after eating a meal. I was one of those people who always had to have a cigarette after eating a meal, and I think I&#8217;m finally getting past that. I hope.

Thanks for all the encouragement, everyone, it really does help. `:)`
