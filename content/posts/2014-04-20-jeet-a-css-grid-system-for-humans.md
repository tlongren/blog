## Jeet can do things other grids can&#8217;t, and it&#8217;s a CSS Grid System for Humans {.subtitle}

I haven&#8217;t actually used Jeet yet, but am going to be giving it quick run on [CodePen][1] later on today. Here&#8217;s the Jeet description, from [their homepage][2], which is hosted on [GitHub Pages][3], I believe.

> We still build things the way machines read them &#8211; not the way we intuit them. Jeet allows you to express your page grid the same way a human would describe it. No more needlessly nesting elements. No more rigid twelve column rules. Enjoy building faster with less code, and more flexibility with Jeet.

There&#8217;s no license defined for Jeet, at least not one that I could find after searching [their website][2] and [their GitHub repository][4].

There&#8217;s also a [really nice presentation of what sets Jeet apart][5] from other grid systems. It&#8217;s short and definitely worth the watch. 

Getting started using Jeet is pretty easy for most people, you can use SCSS (via Ruby) on Windows, and MacOS/Linux platforms. Or you can use [Stylus][6] if you have [nodejs][7] installed. A screenshot is below of the installation instructions.  
[<img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/longren.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/jeet-getting-started-1024x379.png?resize=700%2C259" alt="jeet-getting-started" width="700" height="259" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6601" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.longren.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/jeet-getting-started.png?resize=1024%2C379&ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/www.longren.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/jeet-getting-started.png?resize=150%2C55&ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/www.longren.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/jeet-getting-started.png?resize=300%2C111&ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.longren.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/jeet-getting-started.png?w=1407&ssl=1 1407w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-recalc-dims="1" />][8]

Jeet also provides some short screencasts that are meant to be easily digestible and easier to remember and understand. The video are all hosted on YouTube but a screenshot of the section from their site is below.  
[<img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/longren.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/jeet-learn-by-example-1024x318.png?resize=700%2C217" alt="jeet-learn-by-example" width="700" height="217" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6600" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.longren.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/jeet-learn-by-example.png?resize=1024%2C318&ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/www.longren.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/jeet-learn-by-example.png?resize=150%2C46&ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/www.longren.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/jeet-learn-by-example.png?resize=300%2C93&ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.longren.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/jeet-learn-by-example.png?w=1363&ssl=1 1363w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-recalc-dims="1" />][9]

Anyway, you should [check Jeet out][2] for your next project requiring a CSS grid. It&#8217;s super easy to start using, I especially liked their note on easy integration:

> Jeet can work in any environment&#8217;s pipeline whether it be a static site in SCSS, a Node package in Stylus, or as a Rails application. Anywhere Stylus or SCSS work, Jeet will work. It&#8217;s that simple.

I like what I&#8217;ve seen of [Jeet][2] so far, and I think you will, too! If the test goes well and I like it as I expect I will, I&#8217;ll probably use it for an upcoming project that is essentially a CSS grid of photos. Since there&#8217;s multiple screenshots in this post, a gallery of them all is below.
