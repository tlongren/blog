## It was a really long day {.subtitle}

I didn&#8217;t have nearly the urge to go outside just to smoke [like I thought I would][1]. I did manage to keep pretty busy though, so I attribute the apparent &#8220;ease&#8221; to that. I really had no nicotine cravings, the patch definitely did its job.

I did have a few instances yesterday where I got this urge to go outside for a cigarette, but got past it by doing a bit of physical activity. If that urge was still there, I&#8217;d just sit down and start working to get my mind off it. The physical activity usually took care of it, though.

I&#8217;m currently on the 21mg patch, and will be using it for 4 weeks. Then I&#8217;l step down to the 14mg patch for 2 weeks, and then down to a 7mg patch for another 2 weeks.

I&#8217;ve never been this long without a cigarette before, feels good man.
