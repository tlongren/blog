So, I just upgraded this server to [PHP 5.0.5][1] with the [0.4.2 hardening patch][2]. All seemed to be going well until I tried to look at my WordPress ShortStat page. It no longer loads from within my WordPress dashboard. [WP-ShortStat][3] is a plugin for WordPress that&#8217;s based on [ShortStat by Shaun Inman][4]. When I say ShortStat I mean the WordPress plugin, WP-ShortStat.

The table that stores ShortStat data has roughly 150,000 records. ShortStat is still logging statistics to the database table, it&#8217;s method for displaying the data within the WordPress dashboard is just broken. Very annoying as I very much enjoy watching the ShortStat page for this blog. I&#8217;ll either fix it tonight or find some other method for tracking visitor stats.

The end user shouldn&#8217;t notice anything different in the functionality of the site.

**UPDATE:** After commenting out the following piece of code on line 605 of wp-shortstat.php everything works fine.

<pre>gmdate("g:i a j M Y",$wpss->getFirstHit()+(((gmdate('I'))?
($wpss->$tz_offset+1):$wpss->$tz_offset)*3600));</pre>

Take not that if you remove the code listed above from line 605 of wp-shortstat.php, the date will no longer display at the top of the &#8220;Hits/Uniques&#8221; section. The date displayed there is the very first date WP-ShortStat started logging. So that&#8217;s the only adverse effect you should notice from removing that line.
