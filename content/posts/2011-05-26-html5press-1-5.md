[HTML5Press 1.5][1] is now [available for download][2].

This is a major new release incorporating all [the updates Jesper made][3] to his [HTML5 template][4].

A couple other changes I made to the WordPress theme:

  1. Switch back to jQuery that&#8217;s bundled with WordPress
  2. Post tags are now shown with the rest of the post meta info

You can download HTML5Press [from the HTML5Press page][5]. Check out [Github][6] if you want to keep up on the latest changes to HTML5Press.

**UPDATE 5/27/2011:** I released HTML5Press 1.5.1 earlier. 1.5.1 adds the featured post slider to whatever page you have set as your front page, weather it&#8217;s a list of posts, or a static page. You can download 1.5.1 at the [official HTML5Press page][5]. 

<div class="wpulike wpulike-default " >
  <div class="wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked">
    <button type="button"
					aria-label="Like Button"
					data-ulike-id="2865"
					data-ulike-nonce="01551f21ee"
