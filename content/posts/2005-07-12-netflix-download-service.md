The [Hacking Netflix blog][1] has screenshots of a supposed movie downloading system from [NetFlix][2]. Below is a little of what they have to say.

> I just noticed in my account info page, there is a section for &#8220;Netflix Player&#8221; with a link to &#8220;Register Player&#8221;. If I follow the link, there is a form to &#8220;Add a Netflix Player&#8221;, and it asks for &#8220;Registration ID&#8221; and &#8220;Name your box&#8221;. I haven&#8217;t noticed this before. I wonder if this is a new service that they are rolling out. Could this be something to do with movies-on-demand? Or do they have a netflix-branded movie player of some kind? Interesting&#8230;.

You can [see the screenshot][3] on their site. It&#8217;s good to see some companies are getting ready to offer downloadabale movies. I was skeptical if this would ever happen, looks like it&#8217;s gonna though. I wouldn&#8217;t distribute movies via this method simply due to security concerns. It&#8217;s only a matter of time before someone figures out how to download movies from them without paying.
