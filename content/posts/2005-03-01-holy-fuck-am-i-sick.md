Yah, I haven&#8217;t been this sick in a long time. I think this is the first time in like 3 years I&#8217;ve been sick.

I didn&#8217;t go to work yesterday. I had a fever of about 102. A bunch of other people at work are sick too. Tom is going home early today and coming back in at 5:00pm to process orders and do a few other things. I called Pam and she said I need to go the doctor so I can come back to work. There&#8217;s no way that&#8217;ll happen since they won&#8217;t even provide me with health insurance.

If I&#8217;m not better by tomorrow I&#8217;ll probably spend my own money to go to the doctor. It&#8217;s a good thing I got my tax return back, or I probably wouldn&#8217;t go to the doctor.

One guy at work has walking pnemonia and bronchitis. I almost think I have the same thing, my chest is killing me. I&#8217;ve stopped smoking since I got sick, that should help me get better. Hopefully I don&#8217;t start smoking again after I get better. I am gonna try hard not to.
