## Lolcat-style photos as you commit

I&#8217;ve always had problems installing [lolcommits][1] on Xubuntu and other Ubuntu-based Linux distributions.

The installation instructions are very simple. Only requiring you to run two commands, sudo apt-get install mplayer imagemagick libmagickwand-dev and then sudo gem install lolcommits (need `sudo` for linux). Pretty simple.

The gem install lolcommits command is where things usually go bad for me. I typically see something like this:

<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">tyler@echo:~$ sudo gem install lolcommits
Building native extensions.  This could take a while...
ERROR:  Error installing lolcommits:
	ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.

        /usr/bin/ruby1.9.1 extconf.rb
/usr/lib/ruby/1.9.1/rubygems/custom_require.rb:36:in `require': cannot load such file -- mkmf (LoadError)
	from /usr/lib/ruby/1.9.1/rubygems/custom_require.rb:36:in `require'
	from extconf.rb:1:in `&lt;main>'


Gem files will remain installed in /var/lib/gems/1.9.1/gems/oj-2.0.14 for inspection.
Results logged to /var/lib/gems/1.9.1/gems/oj-2.0.14/ext/oj/gem_make.out</pre>

To fix this, you need to install a newer ruby-dev package:

<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">sudo apt-get install ruby1.9.1-dev</pre>

You can now try to install the lolcommits gem again. It&#8217;ll actually install this time:

<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">gem install rdoc</pre>

<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">gem install lolcommits</pre>

A GitHub user [documented this solution][2] in [issue #54][3]. [Another user suggests][4] that the installation guide should be updated to make a note of this, but I haven&#8217;t seen it noted anywhere but in [issue #54][3].

It&#8217;d sure save me a bit of time if it was noted somewhere, that&#8217;s partly why I&#8217;m writing this post.

After you&#8217;ve got lolocommits installed, see [the README on GitHub][5] for usage instructions and examples.

I usually run `lolcommits --enable --delay=2 --fork` when enabling lolcommits. That will capture a photo in a forked process, after a 2 second delay. I like this method because you&#8217;re not left waiting for the photo before being able to type into your terminal again.

Lolcommits is kinda cool, but not really useful in a practical sense. I do use it pretty much everywhere though, and have the default storage location linked to [Copy][6]. That way all my images are in the same place, no matter which machine I&#8217;m using at home.

If nothing else, it&#8217;s something kinda neat to be able to offer to your clients.
