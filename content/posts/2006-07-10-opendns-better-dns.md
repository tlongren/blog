[Wired is running][1] an interesting story on [OpenDNS][2]. What is OpenDNS you ask? &#8220;OpenDNS makes the Internet experience safer, faster and smarter for you and everyone using your network.&#8221; Here&#8217;s a peice from the article:

> The OpenDNS system, which will open its servers to the public Monday, wants to be a more user-friendly name resolution service than those provided by ISPs, with technology to keep fraudulent sites out of its listings, correct some typos and help browsers look up web pages faster.

The man behind OpenDNS, David Ulevitch, isn&#8217;t new to DNS by any means. He&#8217;s also the founder of [EveryDNS][3], which I used to use to host this site. It&#8217;s a great, **free** service.

OpenDNS is also free. I just updated our DHCP server to serve the OpenDNS IP addresses as DNS servers instead of the ones provided by [Midiowa Net][4]. So far, all seems to be working very well. Hopefully they&#8217;re ready for a huge influx of users, I don&#8217;t wanna have to swtich my DNS servers back.

David Ulevitch has a post in the OpenDNS Blog titled &#8220;[Why I Started OpenDNS][5]&#8220;, it&#8217;s really interesting.

> Iâ€™m a little late to the blogging phenomenon, but here we go. I started working on OpenDNS last November to create a new kind of DNS service that can be used by anyone to make their Internet experience better. Since then Iâ€™ve been working hard to bring this to fruition by assembling a fantastic team, developing some really great software and deploying a world-class network. Now Iâ€™m thrilled to introduce the free service weâ€™ve been building. Itâ€™s ready, and I want you to try it. You will love it.

All in all, the service looks very promising. I think a &#8220;smarter&#8221; DNS system will prove to be very beneficial. [Thanks to Venture Geek][6] for reminding me where I&#8217;ve seen the name &#8220;David Ulevitch&#8221; before, at EveryDNS!

Remember, [you have a choice][7] in who provides you with DNS services.
