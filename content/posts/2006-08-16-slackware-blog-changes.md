On Monday, [I made a post on the Slackware Blog][1], asking for volunteers to help me with posting. I got two emails and two comments to the post offering assistance, much better turnout than I expected.

Anyway, I&#8217;ve added three new bloggers so far: [James Bowling][2], [lssantaanna][3], and [some guy whose name I don&#8217;t exactly know yet][4].

James has [already started posting][5], which is totally awesome. I was trying to find some time to post about the recent changelog updates but James beat me to it. I think the four of us should be able to generate some pretty good content, but we&#8217;ll just have to wait and see.

Traffic to the Slackware Blog has been growing steadily. Especially since the [release of Slackware 11.0 Release Candidate 1][6]. The site gets pretty good placement on Google for a number of slackware related terms.
