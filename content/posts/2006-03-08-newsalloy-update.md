My favorite news/rss reader, [NewsAlloy][1], is undergoing a pretty major update. It&#8217;s supposed to be back up sometime tomorrow, if not sooner.

[The developer (lordtime)][2] is changing all the MySQL tables over to InnoDB from MyISAM. He&#8217;s pretty confident it will result in a decent performance boost. I haven&#8217;t had any problems with the speed or performance of NewsAlloy since I started using it.  
<!--adsense#ypn-->

  
He also mentions in that post that we can expect a few pleasant surprises after this MySQL update is out of the way. I really love NewsAlloy.
