John is changing [TBTN][1] to follow [Blogs Of War][2] a little more:

Via [Blogs of War][3]:

> Weâ€™ve made some major changes to [Take Back The News][1]. The site now shares a a template with Blogs of War and like Blogs of War itâ€™s powered by WordPress. This will streamline our administrative work, get more stories â€œabove the fold&#8221;, and eventually allow us to deploy some interesting features. Uniting the two sites with a common platform and look and feel will also allow readers of the two sites to more easily navigate between them. My focus here at Blogs of War wonâ€™t be changing but I think itâ€™s cool that Blogs of War readers can now click on the the TBTN link under the logo and get a much more complete (and hopefully interesting) take on the rest of the news.
