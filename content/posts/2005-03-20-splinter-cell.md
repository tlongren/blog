I finally got around to beating the first Splinter Cell game on Xbox a few weeks ago. After doing so, I went out and bought Splinter Cell Pandora Tomorrow. I just beat that game yesterday. Pandora Tomorrow is a hell of a lot easier than the first Splinter Cell game.

Pandora Tomorrow only took me about a week to beat. Splinter Cell Chaos Theory is supposed to be coming out sometime this month, I&#8217;m prolly gonna pick it up as soon as it&#8217;s out. Chaos Theory supposedly has a cooperative campaign mode, that should be interesting.

I got my new video card working. I get an average of 3100fps, a lot better than the 100fps I was getting with my Radeon. This machine has a much snappier feel to it now. I am very happy with it.

I need to get heading to work now though. Boo! I hope I&#8217;m done before noon so I can make it out to my mom&#8217;s house before 1:00 so I can eat with them. Jessica is supposed to get confirmed today, I can&#8217;t make cuz of work though.
