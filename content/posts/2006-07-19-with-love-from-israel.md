Go Isreal! Tear those Hezbollah pansies down! w00t! Seriously though, Israel is doing a good thing by attacking Hezbollah and Lebanon. They&#8217;re simply defending what&#8217;s theirs. Had Israel been left alone they wouldn&#8217;t have gone on the offensive. Civilians are going to die, there&#8217;s absolutely, positively no way to avoid civilian casualties when you&#8217;re firing rockets back and forth.

[This guy&#8217;s pissed off][4] about the Israeli girls putting &#8220;greeting&#8221; messages on rockets being launched from Israel. The messages are, of course, intended for the Hezbollah members on the receiving end, not for the kids and other civilians that get caught in the wrong place at the wrong time.

It really warms my heart to see those little girls writing on the shells. Arabs have been teaching their kids to hate Israelis for how long now? Israel has long been the target of Arab nations. It&#8217;s so freakin asinine how people and more specifically Muslims/Arabs get upset when Israel starts defending itself. I really think we&#8217;re probably seeing the beginning of World War III. I knew it&#8217;d happen within 5 years.
