I got a DVD burner yesterday. It&#8217;s quite nice. I&#8217;ve already been able to free up about 50Gb on one of my hard drives. I got a [Sony DRU-800A][1]. Ashley got it for me for my birthday along with a 50 pack of 4.7Gb DVD-R&#8217;s.

It&#8217;s a lot quicker than I thought it&#8217;d be. Only takes about 15-20 minutes to burn a full 4.7Gb DVD. I&#8217;d been wanting a DVD burner for a while, thanks to Ashley I got one. I hope she doesn&#8217;t attempt to buy me anything else for my birthday, I know she will though.

I also installed Windows Vista lastnight, it sucked. It sucked from what I saw anyway. Display was horrible and for some reason 192.168.1.1 isn&#8217;t a &#8220;proper&#8221; internet gateway address. So I couldn&#8217;t even get online to get drivers. I hate it when software tells me something I know isn&#8217;t true. My router&#8217;s IP is 192.168.1.1, so it IS my god damn gateway address. It was basically just a good reminder as to why I use [Slackware][2].

Oh, below is a picture of the DVD burner.
