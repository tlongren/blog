After watching that interview, I can safely say that Ramsey Clark believes every word Saddam says. Whatever Saddam says, Ramsey Clark takes it as fact. He&#8217;s more of a puppet than I thought he was. There was some undisputable senility in Ramsey&#8217;s talking too, poor old fella. I&#8217;d think one would need to be senile, at the very least, to defend Saddam though, so it makes sense.

Ramsey is a little too worried about Saddam&#8217;s civil rights. Saddam doesn&#8217;t have civil rights anymore. It&#8217;s a known fact that he&#8217;s had a hand in murdering at the very least hundreds of people. I know he&#8217;s got basic civil rights, but those shouldn&#8217;t even be granted to him. Money shouldn&#8217;t be wasted on a trial. All that&#8217;s required is a bullet, I&#8217;ll fuckin buy it. Shit, I&#8217;ll buy a whole clip.

[NewsBusters][1] has some of the interview in text. [The Political Teen][2] has the video of the interview. The NewsBusters video seems to be pointing to a bunch of Google AdSense ads right now&#8230;

Also, Greg at [The Political Pit Bull][3] thinks he might be too young to fully understand the evils perpetrated by Saddam. He&#8217;s got a link to an article by Cliff May that sheds some light for we young bucks.

[Jihad Watch][4] has named Ramsey Clark as &#8220;The American Dhimmi of the Year 2005.&#8221; A very well deserved title for Mr. Clark.
