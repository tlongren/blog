I&#8217;m finally selling some of my unused hardware. I sold my Asus P2B-DS motherboard + 1 PII 400mhz processor for $140 shipped. I also sold a socket 370 celeron 566 for $31. Supposedly I&#8217;ve sold a Slot1 PII 350mhz processor, but I haven&#8217;t recieved any money from the guy yet, so I&#8217;m not sure if he&#8217;s really serious about buying from me.

I&#8217;ve been going through some of my old stuff. I really need to get rid of a lot of it. I think I want to sell my 30gb IBM 75gxp hdd soon. It&#8217;s just sitting here not getting used. It&#8217;ll probably just need RMA&#8217;ed like my last 75gxp.
