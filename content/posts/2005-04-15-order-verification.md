Yay! The guys @ the warehouse are verifying all senior orders today and tomorrow. I&#8217;m so excited that the system is finally going how it needs to be. I&#8217;ve been down to Ankeny the last 3 weekends in a row I think. At least I&#8217;m getting some good overtime.

Mike Schilling, the guy that does all our software, came down to Ankeny last Friday so he could fix up a few things. Everything is working much better now. I got the queries to generate a milk order for our senior clients all setup and working yesterday. The warehouse guys are testing it out today. I hope I don&#8217;t have to go down there any this week.

Today I&#8217;m gonna be writing some PHP to improve the order import process and to allow our warehouse manager to update UPC values in the database. Some of our products aren&#8217;t consistent and their UPC&#8217;s change every so often. Being able to update the UPC value for an item is almost a necessity.

I think we&#8217;re planning to get another verification system as soon as this one is up and running 100%. We also got the ethernet connection back to the warehouse/cooler going. Now I just need to go grab a WAP and a Wireless card and they&#8217;ll be set. I&#8217;m very happy that the guys in Ankeny should be able to scan all senior orders without any problems.
