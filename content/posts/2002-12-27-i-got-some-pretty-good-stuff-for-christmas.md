For Christmas this year, I recieved a number of useful and fun things. My mother and step-father got me some new towels (that were badly needed) and a sandwich maker. The sandwich maker will be handy because now I&#8217;ll be able to make grilled cheese.

I got a new <A href=http://www.olympusamerica.com/cpg\_section/cpg\_product_lobbypage.asp?l=1&p=16&bc=1&product=867>Olympus D-550 Digital Camera</a> from my father and step-mother. It&#8217;s pretty nice. It takes really good quality pictures and seems to be pretty easy on batteries. Now to get it to work with Linux&#8230;

Kristin got me a pea coat from Gap. It&#8217;s a little too big for me though, so I need to exchange it sometime.
