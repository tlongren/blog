[Sage][1] is a feed reader for [Mozilla Firefox][2]. I just recently started using [BlogLines][3] and then I found Sage. I&#8217;ll probably keep ALL my feeds in [BlogLines][3] and just import them into Sage every so often.

> **Sage** is a lightweight RSS and Atom feed aggregator extension for Mozilla [Firefox][4]. It&#8217;s got a lot of what you need and not much of what you don&#8217;t.
> 
> Major Features:
> 
> * Reads RSS (2.0, 1.0, 0.9x) and Atom feeds  
> * Feed Discovery  
> * Integrates with Firefox&#8217;s bookmark storage and Live Bookmarks  
> * Imports and exports OPML feed lists  
> * Newspaper feed rendering customizable via style sheets  
> * Technorati and RSS search engine integration  
> * Support for the following locales: Argentine Spanish, Catalan, Chinese, Czech, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Serbian, Slovenian, Spanish, and Swedish  
> * Simple, one step install / uninstall 

I haven&#8217;t been able to find a feed reader I like for Windows but I think Sage will work well for me. It&#8217;s simple and very quick. All the readers I&#8217;ve tried for Windows are really slow. I&#8217;ve been using [Blam!][5] on my [Dropline Gnome][6] desktop. I previously used [Liferia][7].
