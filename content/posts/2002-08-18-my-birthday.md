Yesterday was my birthday. It was a pretty good day.

First off, my step mom (Carol), Kyle, and I went to look for a puppy. We found one and decided to bring him home. Dad acted like he wasn&#8217;t very excited, but I think he really was. You can see pictures of the puppy at <http://www.dive2live.com/>.

Then the cable guy came and fixed out internet and tv. They kept screwing us over. They told us we needed to be home all of Friday, then they called and said we had to be home all day Saturday because they weren&#8217;t going to come on Friday. It wasn&#8217;t good. Needless to say, Dad got very angry with them.

Later in the evening we went to a race at the Jefferson Speedway with [Alan][1]. He sponsors a car. The car he sponsors got fisrt and Alan was really excited. The guy barely won, so it was pretty exciting. The driver of the car is really good.
