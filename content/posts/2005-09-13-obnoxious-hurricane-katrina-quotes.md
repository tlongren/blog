John Hawkins at [Right Wing News][1] has compiled a list of the [top 20 most obnoxious Katrina hurricane quotes][2]. Yah, it&#8217;s a right of center site, but the republicans aren&#8217;t safe. He&#8217;s got obnoxious quotes from both the left and the right.

I wonder if these people actually believe what they said or if they were just saying it to get a reaction out of people. Doesn&#8217;t really matter I guess because they said it, and most of it&#8217;s really funny.

Anyone have any news on the blackout yesterday in Los Angeles? Saw something about it on Fark but never really saw anything else anywhere. Last I knew there was still no known cause.

**UPDATE:** OK, [GOP Vixen][3] has news on the blackout in Los Angeles. Turns out an electrical worker cut the wrong line, bet he feels like a dumb ass. Mark in Mexico has an [illustration of the cutting][4] if you care to take a look.
