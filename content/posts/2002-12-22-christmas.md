Christmas is coming soon. I still have to buy presents for quite a few people. I don&#8217;t like going Christmas shopping. I would just buy everything online, but I don&#8217;t want to use my credit card too much.

For those of you that are interested, here&#8217;s my christmas wish-list:  
1.) <A href=http://www.crutchfield.com/cgi-bin/S-3BgieyH91Hu/ProdView.asp?s=0&c=3&g=110&I=113KAC929&o=m&a=0>Kenwood KAC-929 Car Amp</a>  
2.) <A href=http://www.crutchfield.com/cgi-bin/S-3BgieyH91Hu/ProdView.asp?s=0&c=10&g=67700&I=236T6124A&o=m&a=0>2 MTX Thunder6000 T6124A 12&#8243; Sub</a>

That&#8217;s pretty much it. I&#8217;d really like to get a better sounding stereo system in my car. I need something that will get good sound from my Kenwood mp3 player.
