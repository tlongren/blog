So, I&#8217;m writing a book for [Packt Publishing][1]. The book is going to be called WordPress Multisite Administration. I bet (hope) you can guess what the topic of the book is. ðŸ™‚

WordPress Multisite Administration will be available in both traditional book form, and e-book form. 

It will be a great resource for folks wanting to try WordPress&#8217;s multisite functionality out. It&#8217;ll be relevant to various use-cases, such as a simple team blog, or a private blog network, similar to [WordPress.com][2].

I&#8217;m very, very excited for the opportunity and the people at Packt have been awesome to work with. I&#8217;ll post more details here as the book gets closer to being finished, it&#8217;s still in very early development.

If you&#8217;ve got any suggestions for topics you&#8217;d like to see covered in the book, let me know and I&#8217;ll see what I can do.
