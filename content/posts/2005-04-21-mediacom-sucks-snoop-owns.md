They weren&#8217;t able to fix my cable internet yesterday. The tech that was out said Mediacom is pushing more data over their lines now to support their VOIP system they&#8217;re rolling out. He said this is most likely the reason my modem will no longer sync. He said they&#8217;ll probably have to re-wire most of the building. I&#8217;m supposed to get ahold of the guy that owns it and have him setup a meeting with someone from Mediacom. The tech suspects there&#8217;s people getting illegal cable in our building. So who knows when it&#8217;s going to be fixed.

Snoop Dogg was awesome lastnight. The Game was pretty good too, I actually enjoyed his show more than Snoop I think. There was lots of cops. We left about 5 minutes before everyone else and we got stopped by some girl that needed us to jump her car. I didn&#8217;t really wanna help her but Ashley insisted. It only took about 10 minutes to get her car going. Overall it was a really good show.
