Please, please, please post a comment to this news post. Please? Nobody ever posts comments. This website doesn&#8217;t get a whole lot of traffic, so if you&#8217;re reading this, please post a comment.

I host this site off my dial-up, so it&#8217;s slow as dirt. We often have files downloading here at home, so I apologize for the slowness. When I get a faster connection, I plan to add more to this site and begin promoting it a bit more. **😉**
