[Some bloggers in France][1] have been detained for encouraging people to participate in the Paris riots. Doesn&#8217;t seem like a very smart thing to do given the situation. French bloggers are apparently split on this, some encouraging the riots, others attempting to bring peace and quiet. H/T [Boing Boing][2].

> Two bloggers have been detained by authorities in France on suspicion of encouraging people to take part in the Paris riots.
> 
> A 16-year-old French teenager and an 18-year-old of Ghanaian nationality are being questioned by Paris prosecutors, according to reports.
> 
> One of the blogs was called &#8220;sarkodead&#8221;, a reference to the interior minister and presidential contender, Nicholas Sarkozy, who referred to the rioters in disparaging terms and has been singled out for criticism by many French bloggers.

Boing Boing also points to an article written by Thomas Crampton (who&#8217;s [been covering the riots][3]) in which he discusses the role blogs and SMS (text messages) played in the riots in France.

This could make for some really interesting news when more information starts coming out. There&#8217;s a lot of talk about this going on at French blogs, but I don&#8217;t know French.
