I had a good weekend. I went to a party here in Ames on Friday night. I got home around 9:00 saturday morning.

I went up to UNI on saturday to visit Kristin. Her family was up there for family weekend. We went to the UNI football game. Didn&#8217;t do much of anything on Saturday night.

Yesterday I did homework and tried fixing the dreamcast. Tonight I&#8217;m going to see if I can find a used dreamcast somewhere, I broke mine.
