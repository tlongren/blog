Bill Roggio of [The Fourth Rail][1] has been invited to spend a month in Iraq with the Marines he&#8217;s been supporting religiously for the last year.

[The Fourth Rail][2] already has some of the best, totally original iraq/war related material. Bill&#8217;s taking an &#8220;unpaid leave of absence&#8221; from his current job to go blog in Iraq. I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;d [gladly accept donations][1] so he doesn&#8217;t have to sell a kidney or something when he gets back the U.S. He&#8217;s currently planning on leaving in mid-November.

It also sounds like he won&#8217;t be blogging via The Fourth Rail once in Iraq. Bill and some buddies are starting [a new site][3] that&#8217;s &#8220;focused on national and international security threats and the U.S. led war on terror.&#8221; Should be good, so keep an eye on [ThreatsWatch.org][3] for more.
