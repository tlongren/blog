Someone stole the label PC from work lastnight. It happened after 11:00 pm, because there was a fresh backup from that pc on the backup server this morning.

The last kitchen shift leaves at midnight. It was probably one of the mexicans on that shift. Only the tower was gone.

There&#8217;s a parallel port &#8220;key&#8221; that we need to have so our label printing software will work. The theif just unplugged the cable from the key instead of taking the key and cable off at the same time. So, the key that we need is still on the stolen PC.

I setup another pc to replace it early this morning only to realize that I needed that key. The only way we can get another is by purchasing the software again, which costs $700.

I&#8217;ve had to buy 2 pc&#8217;s in the last 2 days now.
