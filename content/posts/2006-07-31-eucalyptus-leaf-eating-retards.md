[Wombats don&#8217;t like to fight][1]. Some guy in Toledo had a bunch of Wombats in an attempt to start a wombat-fighting ring. Apparently he was pretty upset when his Wombats didn&#8217;t exhibit any violent behavior:

> &#8220;The bastard who sold them to me said they were vicious killers,&#8221; said Kensington. &#8220;I paid $300 bucks for a pair of eucalyptus-leaf eating retards who just stare at each other with a dull glare.&#8221;
> 
> Kensington tried many techniques to get the wombats to fight, but all they would do is &#8220;eat and breed.&#8221;
> 
> &#8220;Yeah, I tried poking &#8217;em with sticks, yelling at &#8217;em, and dumping acid on their heads, but nothing seemed to work,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They just sit there and stare at you, drooling and grunting.&#8221;
> 
> The animals, said Kensington, have been a bad investment, and he was &#8220;relieved&#8221; when police arrived.
> 
> &#8220;Not only will they not fight, but they dig their way out of every kennel I&#8217;ve built,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Good riddance, I say about the smelly bastards.&#8221;

Dumb ass.
