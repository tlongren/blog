I got that 1.8Ghz P4 pc from work yesterday. I got [Slackware 10][1] and [Dropline Gnome][2] installed on it lastnight. It&#8217;s working pretty well. I&#8217;m glad to have my music back, all of it was on an ide hard drive, and I didn&#8217;t have any way to read it until I got this PC.

Also, [Linux Kernel 2.4.27][3] has been released. It seems like 2.4.26 was around forever! 2.4.27 took a long time to come out.
