## Light Your Night {.subtitle}

[I quit smoking][1], and I&#8217;ve been running a little here and there. Usually do about a half mile in about 7 minutes, so I&#8217;m really slow. In my defense, I haven&#8217;t actively run since high school, about 15 years ago or so, but still. Gimmie a year and I&#8217;m going to do my first 5k. `:)`

Anyway, these [Lunar Armbands look awesome][2], and I just pre-ordered 2 of them.

I tend to get a &#8220;second wind&#8221; around 10pm, probably all the caffeine during the day. Anyway, about that time is the only time I have the motivation to go out and run, especially in the cold. I haven&#8217;t run at night yet simply because I don&#8217;t have any real running gear and nothing really reflective. I&#8217;ve got plenty of athletic gear, but nothing for night.

[<img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/longren.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Lunar-Armbands-walkawaygif-cut.gif?resize=513%2C289" alt="Lunar-Armbands-walkawaygif-cut" width="513" height="289" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6366" data-recalc-dims="1" />][3]

Here&#8217;s a description [from their site][2]:

> What sets Lunar Armbands apart from traditional reflective clothing is its ability to illuminate users in pitch black conditions with no alternate light source. The Lunar Armband easily attaches to your arm, wrist or ankle with an adjustable Velcro strap.
> 
> It has three different light settings ranging from fast blink, to slow blink, to a solid band of light. Lunar Armband enables users to safely go about their life whether it be an early morning run, a late night bike ride or a night out at a concert.

You can [pre-order now right from their website][2].

I just pre-ordered, and _can not wait_ to get them. Sounds like they&#8217;ll be shipping in about 14 days. For more updates, [check out their blog][4].

I really dig the look of these things, so, below is a gallery of assorted [Lunar Armbands][2].

And here&#8217;s a video of Matt Hall, one of the Co-Founders, testing out some of the armbands.
