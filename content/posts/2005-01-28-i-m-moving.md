Yup, I&#8217;m moving out of the tin box I now live in. I&#8217;ll be moving in with Ashley this weekend. Brad&#8217;s girlfriend is gonna be moving in with him soon, so it&#8217;s definately for the best.

I called Mediacom lastnight to get the cable shut off at the tin box. That&#8217;s supposed to happen saturday. I also scheduled an installation date for them to activate the cable at Ashleys place. The first time they can make it out is Feb. 23. I&#8217;m pissed off. I can&#8217;t deal without internet for that long. I plan on calling them again tonight and reminding them that I work from home (which I do sometimes), so waiting a month for service isn&#8217;t an option.

I was reading the Mediacom forums today on [dslreports.com][1] and noticed a guy had mentioned he put in a call for repair. He also mentioned that Mediacom would have someone to his place by &#8220;the end of the week&#8221;. So, there&#8217;s no way in hell I&#8217;m gonna wait that long. They&#8217;ll lose me as a customer if I do.

So, this website might not be around for a little while. I&#8217;m planning on moving it over to a server here @ work so it&#8217;s not completely offline for an extended period of time. I&#8217;m excited to move though. I don&#8217;t like living in my current residence anymore.
