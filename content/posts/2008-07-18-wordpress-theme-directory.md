There&#8217;s finally [an official repository][1] for WordPress themes! The new [WordPress Theme Directory][1] replaces [themes.wordpress.net][2], which hasn&#8217;t been accepting new themes for quite some time now, more than a year.  
[ad]  
WordPress theme developers can login to [WordPress.org][3] and upload their themes for review. The Theme Directory doesn&#8217;t require Subversion like the [Plugin Directory][4] does, which should make it much easier for theme developers to get their themes in the directory.

You can [read more][5] about the new WordPress Theme Directory at the [WordPress blog][5].
