[Austen Dicken][1] has been working on [VLC Media Player for Android devices][2]. He stresses that it&#8217;s not stable and is still in the pre-alpha stages. I installed it the other day and haven&#8217;t noticed any real problems with it.

There&#8217;s two builds of VLC for Android available for download on Austen&#8217;s site. There&#8217;s a NEON version and a NONEON version. The NEON build is for devices that have processors that support NEON floating-point extensions.  
[ad]  
If you&#8217;ve got a Motorola Defy or Motorola Defy+, you&#8217;ll want the NEON build. The processors in both phones are similar and both support NEON floating-point extensions.  
<!--more-->

  
If you don&#8217;t have one of those devices, it&#8217;s easy to find out what build you need. Just open /proc/cpuinfo on your phone and look for NEON in the Features line. If NEON is listed there, you want the NEON build. If NEON isn&#8217;t listed, get the NONEON build. You may need to root your phone before you can access /proc/. I use  
[Root Explorer][3] for browsing my root filesystem.

The contents of your /proc/cpuinfo file will look similar to this:
