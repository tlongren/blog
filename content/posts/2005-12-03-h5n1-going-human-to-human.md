Dan at [Riehl World View][1] is wondering if H5N1 (the Avian flu we&#8217;ve been hearing about) has begun transferring from human to human.

Dan&#8217;s also got an important update containing information from [Hyscience][2].

> Hyscience &#8211; I believe the report, and have actually reported of H to H transmission of H5N1 over a year ago &#8211; and not picked up on by media and agencies. [here][3], [here][4], and( [here][5] which sourced [this research report][6] that human to human transmission actually occured in July / early August 2004 &#8211; but not covered by media or agencies)

[Hyscience][7] is always a really good source of news for stuff like this. Richard has done a really nice job with the site. It&#8217;s been one of my long time favorites. You can&#8217;t find [information like this][2] at many other places:

> Indonesia was in the news in November as a result of its decision to begin manufacturing (pirating) the anti-flu drug Tamiflu (oseltamavir), but they are likely to be disappointed in the results, should they elect to depend upon it for protection against the H5N1 virus ([it&#8217;s already showing resistance to tamiflu][8]). Previously, genetic sequencing of influenza A (H5N1) virus samples from human cases in Vietnam and Thailand showed resistance to the [antiviral medications amantadine and rimantadine][4], 2 of the other medications commonly used for treatment of influenza. This would leave 1 remaining antiviral medication (zanamavir) that may still be effective against currently circulating strains of H5N1. This fact has not been sufficiently covered by cable and print media.

I usually wouldn&#8217;t write about this sort of topic, simply because it doesn&#8217;t really affect me at this exact point in time, call me selfish. And I&#8217;d be seriously pissed if I were to lose my life to a bird flu. I can&#8217;t imagine dying from a bird flu. If I did and it were possible, I&#8217;d be ashamed of my death. This does deserve attention though, especially if it&#8217;s confirmed human to human transmission has occured. I wonder exactly how much quicker it would spread, given human to human transmission is possible at this time.

> Officials in at least two nations now suspect the avian flu bug has mutated into a virus that is being transmitted from human to human â€“ a development world health authorities have estimated could result in the deaths of tens of millions.
> 
> Thai health officials have expressed concern that the country&#8217;s two latest confirmed victims may be the beginning of the much feared human-to-human transmission.

Go read [Dan&#8217;s post at Riehl World View][1] for a link to the full article above. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s all bad though. The sheer amount of people on Earth is getting a little out of hand, something like H5N1 could put a nice little dent in the number. We _are_ due for another &#8220;cleansing&#8221; event, I can&#8217;t imagine a better time than now.
