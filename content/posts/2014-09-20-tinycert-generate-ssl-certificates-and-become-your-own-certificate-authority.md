A few days ago I moved longren.io to `https`. I didn&#8217;t pay for a certificate though like I would when setting up an e-commerce site or something else important.

I even get the little green lock symbol in the address bar, but I think this is mostly due to my use of [Cloudflare][1].

[TinyCert][2] is a service I discovered that lets you be your own [PKI][3]/[certificate authority][4]. It&#8217;s entirely free and provides you with a very nice interface for managing your certificates. The image below shows the interface for managing your certificates. The list on the right is a list of certificates, as you can see I&#8217;ve got one made up for longrendev.io, but haven&#8217;t put it in place quite yet.

The support from TinyCert is very good as well, I had a few questions regarding how their certificates would work with Cloudflare and they quickly cleared my questions up. SSL Labs from Qualys gives the [SSL certificate an &#8220;**A**&#8221; rating][6]. Should you use certificates from TinyCert in production? Probably not. I am, however, due to my use of Cloudflare.

This post isn&#8217;t meant to show you how to install certificates or use TinyCert, it&#8217;s simply to make you aware of the tool and what can be done with it. TinyCert has a pretty [extensive FAQ][8], so should you have questions, which I&#8217;m sure you do, head on over and start reading. If you do need help installing the certificates from TinyCert, their [help center][9] does a nice job of providing instructions for Apache and Nginx based setups. 

Have fun with TinyCert, it&#8217;s a pretty awesome service that I&#8217;ll continue to use and will absolutely be donating to. **But please remember, TinyCert certificates should not be used for regular public websites and the service is not a substitute for a proper certification authority, but for self-signed certificates**.
