[Slackware 11.0 Release Candidate 5][1] is here. Lots of updates to existing packages. Not many packages were upgraded. Patrick is giving the scouts honor that this will be the last RC before 11.0 final.

[Head on over to the Slackware Blog][1] to have a look at the full changelog entry. Hopefully we will see Slackware 11.0 released sometime next week or maybe even by the end of the week since we&#8217;ve seen such a long RC cycle. I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ve seen anything greater than RC2 since Slackware 9.0 or so. It&#8217;s been a while since we&#8217;ve seen this many release candidates.
