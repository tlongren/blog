&#8230;but gas prices suck. I know, it&#8217;s expected to start going down in Ocboter or so, but that&#8217;s two months away.

I remember when I could fill my car on $15. That&#8217;s 12 gallons for $15. It runs me right about $30 to fill my car now. About $35 to fill Ashley&#8217;s car at any given gas station.

I can&#8217;t continue paying for gas if prices remain as they are. I could walk to work every day, but then I&#8217;d have to get up even earlier. And walking in the morning when I&#8217;m tired is no fun.

Gas prices here range from $2.26 to $2.55 per gallon. When I first started driving (5 years ago), I remember prices per gallon were just under $1. I would kill for those prices again.

[Cheap Gas][1] can help though. I think I&#8217;ve talked about it before. A google maps hack that finds the cheapest gas within your area. Really neat tool and probably very helpful when gasoline prices get as expensive as they are.

Personally, I think we as Americans should stop purchasing gasoline for 1 week. Just stop. That&#8217;ll make gasoline prices fall off for a while.
