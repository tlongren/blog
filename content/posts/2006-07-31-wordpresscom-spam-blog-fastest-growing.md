Take a look at this screenshot:  
[<img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/static.flickr.com/77/203212305_090664f1cf_o.png?resize=343%2C335" width="343" height="335" alt="wordpressComBlogSpam" data-recalc-dims="1" />][1]

The [4th fastest growing blog][2] shown there is a spam blog. I thought wordpress.com was having troubles with spam blogs soon after they launched. And I thought they devised a way to prevent it for the most part. I wonder if the spammers have come up with a new method to do their trickery&#8230; 

<div class="wpulike wpulike-default " >
  <div class="wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked">
