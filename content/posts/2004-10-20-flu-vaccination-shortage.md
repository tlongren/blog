Bush and Kerry are taking hits at each other over the looming flu vaccine shortage. Why anyone would listen to this garbage is beyond me.

It seems that there&#8217;s always a flu vaccine shortage around this time of year&#8230;no matter who&#8217;s the president. I wonder if they&#8217;ve ever heard of supply and demand? It&#8217;s a very basic concept taught in most high school economics classes. ðŸ™‚

They should just get angry at consumers for wanting the flu vaccine. I&#8217;m glad election day is almost here. I seriously can&#8217;t take too much more of the campaigning. 

Cheney is supposed to be here in Nevada, Iowa (at the county fair grounds) this Friday. Too bad I&#8217;m still gonna be around, cuz I&#8217;m sure this town will be busy as hell. I just hope there&#8217;s not a bunch of news media all over the place. I won&#8217;t hesitate to run em over.
