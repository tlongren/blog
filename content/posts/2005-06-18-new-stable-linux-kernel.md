It&#8217;s finally come out, [linux kernel 2.6.12][1]. I&#8217;ve been running the various 2.6.11.* kernels for the last few months it seems like. Have been waiting for ever for 2.6.12 stable to come out. Typically I&#8217;ll run the testing kernels, but didn&#8217;t want to upgrade to 2.6.12 before it became stable. No reason really.

I think it came out today. Nearly three and a half months after 2.6.11 was released. [KernelTrap][1] has the best summary I&#8217;ve seen so far. And I haven&#8217;t really read much of the ChangeLog, so I can&#8217;t really say anything about it at the moment. It&#8217;s downloading right now, at unusually slow speeds. Anyway, here&#8217;s what KernelTrap says.

> This is the first stable release of the Linux kernel since the source code was moved out of BitKeeper in early April of 2005 [[story][2]]. 2.6.12-rc3, released in late April, was the first release candidate kernel managed by Git [http://kerneltrap.org/node/5031], thus Linus&#8217; git repository only holds changes since 2.6.12-rc2. Due to this fact, Linus did not release a complete changelog between 2.6.11 [[story][3]] and 2.6.12. He explains, &#8220;the full ChangeLog ended up missing, because I only have the history from 2.6.12-rc2 in my git archives, but if you want to, you can puzzle it together by taking the 2.6.12 changelog and merging it with the -rc1 and -rc2 logs in the testing directory.&#8221; The latest version of the Linux kernel can be obtained directly from the [kernel.org archive][4] [[story][5]], or your [nearest kernel archives mirror][6].

KernelTrap also has links to related stories they&#8217;ve done, mostly about 2.6.12 and about the move to [Git][7] from [BitKeeper][8].
