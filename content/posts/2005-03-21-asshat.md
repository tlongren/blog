I&#8217;m about gonna bring a law suit against my landlord. 

1. Dishwasher broken, promised to be fixed multiple times. A slight tug on the front of it will cause the dishwasher to almost fall out of it&#8217;s place in the counter. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s even hooked up.

2. The carpet in my office was supposed to be replaced before Ashley even moved in. It still hasn&#8217;t been replaced. It smells like cat piss due to the previous owners. Not so bad now that there&#8217;s about 200 candles in here.

3. There&#8217;s a leak in the closet in my office, very near the floor. I noticed a few days ago the floor was damp and it got my socks all wet.

I just removed Ashley&#8217;s christmas tree from the closet to prevent it from getting moldy and icky. After removing the christmas tree, I was able to see more where the leak is at. It&#8217;s right at the bottom of the closet somewhere. The carpet it so shitty I was able to pull it right up. The padding under the carpet is sopping wet, as is the cement under that.

I have yet to tell him about the leak in my office because he&#8217;s on vacation in Africa. Once he gets back I&#8217;m demanding to have the carpet replaced in my office, if he doesn&#8217;t, he won&#8217;t be getting much rent money from me. Why should I have to pay to live in these conditions when I could do so for free outside? This guy spends $0 on maintenance on this place&#8230;seriously.
