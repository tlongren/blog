I noticed this image on the side of the YMCA building in Des Moines the other day while walking back to work from the bank. I&#8217;d never noticed it before so I snapped a quick photo. After looking online for an hour or so, I haven&#8217;t been able to find out what the image represents.

Does anyone have any ideas? I made [a much more detailed post on Medium][1], that includes &#8220;old&#8221; YMCA logos, which this is definitely not. Googling [YMCA logo][2] was little help.

If you have any ideas about what it&#8217;s meaning is, or anything really, you can drop a comment here or on [the thread at Hacker News][3].

**UPDATE:** Thanks to [HN reader MaysonL][4], it‚Äôs pretty safe to say it‚Äôs a [variant of the ‚ÄúChi Rho‚Äù symbol][5]. Looks pretty much spot on to me.
