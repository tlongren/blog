I was having [some problems][1] with my keywords getting deleted when updating a post (using [Jerome&#8217;s Keywords 1.8][2]). The problem was a result of a blank textarea on the page to edit a post. Wasn&#8217;t hard to fix at all.

The textarea, with a header of &#8220;Keywords&#8221;, shows up blank when editing a post. The initial post is good because that text area is filled out manually. jeromes-keywords.php was using &#8220;$postdata->ID&#8221; as a reference in the get\_post\_meta() function. $postdata->ID didn&#8217;t contain any value at all.

After doing a little digging, I found I could get a posts ID using $post->ID, notice the missing &#8220;data&#8221;. It only takes a few steps to get [Jerome&#8217;s Keywords][2] working 100% in WordPress 2.0.  
**1.** Open wp-content/plugins/jeromes-keywords.php in a text editor.  
**2.** On line 553, change the line that says &#8220;global $postdata, $content&#8221; to read &#8220;global $post, $content&#8221;.  
**3.** On line 555, change &#8220;get\_post\_meta($postdata->ID, KEYWORDS\_META, true)&#8221; to &#8220;get\_post\_meta($post->ID, KEYWORDS\_META, true)&#8221;.  
**4.** Save jeromes-keywords.php, you&#8217;re done.

After doing that, the keywords textarea created by the plugin will be populated with your original keywords. I guess that textarea must have the keywords there all the time, even when editing. Before, my keywords weren&#8217;t in the &#8220;keywords&#8221; textarea, they were only in a custom field.

It appears that [Jerome&#8217;s Keywords][2] deletes post meta every time that post is edited. And I think that&#8217;s the desired functionality for some reason. I only say that after looking at the code for a half hour or so. I think the post would end up with one custom field named &#8220;keywords&#8221; for every time the post is edited or updated. So, update a post 4 times and you&#8217;ll have 4 identical custom fields named &#8220;keywords&#8221;.

All of my favorite plugins are now working very well for me with [WordPress 2.0-RC1][1].
