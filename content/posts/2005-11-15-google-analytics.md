So, I signed up for [Google Analytics][1] yesterday. Google Analytics is basically Urchin, but it&#8217;s free. Urchin was bought by Google a year ago or so, I&#8217;m not exactly sure. We were looking into using Urchin for our sites at work. Google is now offering Urchin for free under the name &#8220;Google Analytics&#8221;.

I&#8217;ve been waiting nearly 24 hours now and still no data is showing up for the sites I installed the code on. Hopefully Google set aside a server or network for current paying Urchin customers. Although it appears they didn&#8217;t as some [paying Urchin customers][2] are upset. Google Analytics performance yesterday was piss poor, probably due to the huge influx of traffic after the service announcement showed up on Slashdot.

[Some][3] [others][4] are still waiting on data to show up for their sites too. Luckily I just got Mint, so I&#8217;m not totally in the dark. I&#8217;ll give it a few more days. If there&#8217;s still no data by Thursday evening I&#8217;ll stop checking. Google Analytics says it&#8217;s still &#8220;waiting for data.&#8221;
