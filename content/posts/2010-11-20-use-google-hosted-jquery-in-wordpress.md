So, I recently needed to use a [google hosted version of jquery][1] for a WordPress theme (don&#8217;t ask). I came across [this topic][2] at the WordPress forums.

User [bazil749][3] [suggested][4] doing this, I&#8217;ve updated it to include [jQuery 1.4.4][5]:

<pre>&lt;?php
if( !is_admin()){
	wp_deregister_script(&#39;jquery&#39;);
	wp_register_script(&#39;jquery&#39;, ("http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.4/jquery.min.js"), false, &#39;1.4.4&#39;);
	wp_enqueue_script(&#39;jquery&#39;);
}
?&gt;
</pre>

I added that piece of code to the proper place in the header.php file for the theme and it worked like a champ. jQuery was now loading from Google. The [Use Google Libraries plugin][6] does the same basic thing, except it can use libraries other than just jQuery, like [jQuery UI][7], [Dojo][8], [MooTools][9], and [Protoype][10].

There are [a number of good reasons][11] to let Google host jQuery for you. 

<div class="wpulike wpulike-default " >
  <div class="wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked">
    <button type="button"
					aria-label="Like Button"
					data-ulike-id="2617"
					data-ulike-nonce="519bcd1ad4"
					data-ulike-type="likeThis"
					data-ulike-template="wpulike-default"
					data-ulike-display-likers="0"
					data-ulike-disable-pophover="0"
					class="wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_likethis_2617"></button><span class="count-box"></span>
  </div>
</div>
