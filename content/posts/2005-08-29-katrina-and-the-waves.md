[Hurricane Katrina][1] is bearing down on the gulf coast right about now. I awoke this morning and flipped on FoxNews. I looked at the bottom right of the TV to see how the market was doing, horrible. I think the dow was down something like 300 points. Then they said oil passed $70 a barrell.

My car has no gasoline in it. Maybe enough to make it to work and back. Ashley had to be to work early this morning so I didn&#8217;t ride with her. To make matters worse, I don&#8217;t have any money to get gasoline with. I mean, I have money in my checking account, just no cash on me. And I&#8217;ve still got a paycheck to deposit. But, my bank is no longer open on Saturdays. Saturday is the only time I can make it to the bank. So, I&#8217;ve gotta find a new bank sometime this week. Walking to work this morning wasn&#8217;t so bad.

Katrina is one hell of a storm. It&#8217;s spawning tornadoes all over the place. It also seems the [SuperDome in New Orleans is failing][2]. A piece of the roof has blown off and the sky can be seen from inside the dome. If I was a reporter, I&#8217;d rather be standing in the middle of the street rather than inside the SuperDome.

And supposedly, there&#8217;s [still 100,000 some people in New Orleans][3] (via Wizbang). What&#8217;s worse? Those people will not be able to evacuate the city. This could be very bad if true.

PunditGuy has a [massive amount of links][4] and updates on the storm. [Blogs of War][5] would also be a good resource for information regarding the hurricane.

In addition to the physical destruction that will come from this storm, there&#8217;ll also be [financial troubles][6]. It seems that the federal payroll system is run out of New Orleans. It was supposed to be moved to Kansas City, but not until next summer. Government employees may miss a paycheck or two in the coming weeks.

The [Weatherblog also notes][7] that some of the pumps in New Orleans aren&#8217;t working either. [The Philly Inquirer blog][8] is also worth watching.
