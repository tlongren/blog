My internet connection took a dump on me lastnight around 5:00 pm. It was out until sometime today. I guess a router died somewhere at Mediacom. I don&#8217;t understand why it takes so damn long to get it going again. I wish they would have just asked me to come in to help when I called tech support lastnight. I probably could have fixed it right then and there.
