As most people know, Peterson was sentenced to death in California the other day. The BBC had a section about this on their evening news lastnight.

While watching the BBC, I learned more about the case in 5 minutes than I&#8217;d learned in 1 year watching Fox News and the regular news outlets. The coverage provided by Fox was bullshit. Stupid ass comentators and hosts blathering on about neverending &#8220;what if&#8217;s&#8221; and arguing with eachother.

But yah, the asshat is gonna die in California&#8230;I heard lastnight that California has some 650 other people waiting on death-row. I just think it&#8217;s funny hearing what foreigners have to say about it. They do a much better job of giving the facts than anyone here in the states&#8230;they didn&#8217;t seem biased. That can&#8217;t always be said about the BBC though.
