I&#8217;ve been using the [Digg Integrator plugin][1] for easy Digging of my posts. The Digg Integrator plugin has [had it&#8217;s share of problems lately][2], mostly due to changes the folks at Digg have implemented. WildBil has managed to fix the plugin up quite nicely though, I haven&#8217;t been having any issues with the newest version.  
<!--adsense-->

  
If you&#8217;re having problems with the Digg Integrator plugin, you might wanna [check out the Digg This Reloaded plugin][3]. It&#8217;s got a bunch of nice features similar to features found in the Digg Integrator plugin. Looks like a very promising plugin, I am going to install it and give it a try sometime this week.
