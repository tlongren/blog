Saw this on the [SANS diary][1] today:

> A new sober variant is making the rounds, spreading surprisingly quickly.  
> We have received multiple reports, the file name we have seen is our_secret.zip.  
> Your anti-virus vendor of choice will have named it something interesting, with &#8216;sober&#8217; somewhere in there. 

More info about it can be found here:

The reason I post this is because the domain we use for e-mail got bombed with this virus today. Everyone with a purfoods.com e-mail address recieved multiple copies of it. Luckily I have [Nod32][2] installed on all the PC&#8217;s here in the Nevada office.

They all came from the same Qwest IP address, so I just blocked all e-mails that come from that IP address. Seems to have worked so far.
