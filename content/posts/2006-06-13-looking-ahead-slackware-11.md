**Crossposted from [Slackware Blog][1].**

Well, we&#8217;re getting closer to a [Slackware 11][2] release. What kind of software goodies can we expect from this release? On May 31st, [KDE][3] released KDE 3.5.3, which has since been included in slackware-current. Unless KDE makes another release soon, I expect we&#8217;ll see KDE 3.5.3 included in Slackware 11.

Slackware 11 is still using a 2.4 kernel by default, with the 2.6.16.20 kernel in &#8220;testing&#8221;. [Chess Griffin][4] is guessing Slackware 11 will be released on June 25th. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s gonna happen, but Chess made that guess back in May. I am guessing that Slackware 11 will be released around August 11th. I say that because we haven&#8217;t even seen Slackware 11 Beta 1 yet.

I would expect to see a 2.6 kernel as the default kernel in Slackware 11. Having a 2.4 kernel as the default is something people like to poke fun at Slackware for. Now that kernel 2.6 has been around for a few years, I expect Patrick will set it as the default. Patrick will make the right decision, as he always has, no matter which kernel he chooses to set as the default.

Other new software that will be included in Slackware 11 is [MySQL 5.0][5], [Apache 1.3.36][6], [PHP 4.4.2][7], [Mozilla Firefox 1.5.0.4][8], [Mozilla Thunderbird 1.5.0.4][8], and [X11 6.9.0][9]. Now, this is software that&#8217;s currently included in slackware-current, so the version numbers may change slightly before Slackware 11 is actually released.

So far, it looks like we can expect a nicely polished release of Slackware 11, as usual. I&#8217;m just hoping Patrick decides to go with a 2.6 kernel by default.

On a somewhat releated note, [this guy here at wordpress.com][10] seems to be addicted to his Slackware box. Apparently it&#8217;s caused him to miss a few lunches, he&#8217;s having trouble dragging himself away from the beauty that is Slackware.

> Somebody should drag me away from my PC. Ever since I installed Slackware on it, I could not get myself to stay away from the damn thing. My eyes are hurting, and my stomach is grumbling from missed lunches.
