God this is funny. Russell Crowe said the FBI contacted him in 2001 telling him he was a potential kidnap target for al-Qeada.

All part of a plot to take our hollywood elite away from us to cause &#8220;cultural destabilization&#8221;. Americans must really be seen by the rest of the world as hardcore pussies if taking away actors and those types will supposedly cause our society to collapse.

Or, like the website I read this on speculates, maybe the FBI just overheard someone talking about how good of an actor russell crowe is. I can&#8217;t believe [Google News][1] actually links to shit ass news sources like this:
