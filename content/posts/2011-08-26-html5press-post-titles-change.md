Just wanted to note that I decreased the font size for post titles in HTML5Press. Size [changed from 38px to 28px][1]. You can see an illustration of the change in the image attached to this post.

I&#8217;ve got [some][2] [pretty][3] [long][4] [post][5] [titles][6] [around][7] here, and I know some other people using HTML5Press do too. 

<div class="wpulike wpulike-default " >
  <div class="wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked">
    <button type="button"
					aria-label="Like Button"
					data-ulike-id="2986"
					data-ulike-nonce="9c54d1cc58"
					data-ulike-type="likeThis"
					data-ulike-template="wpulike-default"
					data-ulike-display-likers="0"
					data-ulike-disable-pophover="0"
					class="wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_likethis_2986"></button><span class="count-box"></span>
