[Adobe][1] is set to buy [Macromedia][2] for $3.4 billion. The new company will be called Adobe Systems, Inc. Macromedia makes products such as Flash, Dremweaver, and Fireworks. Adobe is mostly known for Photoshop and Acrobat.

This seems like a pretty logical buy to me for Adobe. Macromedia&#8217;s products go right along with most of Adobe&#8217;s products. Here&#8217;s a link to the press release on Adobe&#8217;s website:  
<http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/invrelations/adobeandmacromedia.html>

I have trouble getting to that site. I bet that server is getting hammered, links to the press release are on [Slashdot][3] and [Fark][4] right now.
