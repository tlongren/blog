I&#8217;ve got 3 e-book copies of WordPress Multisite Administration to give away. To enter, you must retweet the tweet at the end of this post, **_AND_** leave a comment on this blog post. It&#8217;s not [first come first serve this time][1], instead, 3 random entrants will be chosen by my 4 year old daughter.

Deadline for entries is October 30, 2013 at 11:59PM, so get to it. ðŸ™‚

People running WordPress Multisite will be especially interested in this book, but it&#8217;s also a great learning source for people using standard WordPress installations too. There&#8217;s a lot of good practices and other security related material that applies to both multisite installations and single site installations.

If you&#8217;d like to buy this fine book, which I would REALLY appreciate, you can do so from the Packt Publishing website, located at <http://www.packtpub.com/wordpress-multisite-administration/book>.

I hope to get the opportunity to write another book soon about [Anchor CMS][2], which I am absolutely in LOVE with. You can see Anchor CMS in action [at the VPSstat.us blog.][3]
