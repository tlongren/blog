This piece at [The Jawa Report][1] caught my attention this morning. It points out how many moderate muslims don&#8217;t worry themselves with defending their religion as the &#8220;religion of peace&#8221; they say it is.

It&#8217;d be nice to hear some condemnation of terrorist attacks by these moderate muslims. Wouldn&#8217;t it help the Muslim religion as a whole? It would seperate those Muslims who really do believe Islam is the &#8220;religion of peace&#8221; from those that enjoy killing innocent people. There&#8217;d be a clear line of seperation then and the moderate muslims wouldn&#8217;t have to worry as much about being &#8220;persecuted&#8221; because they&#8217;re Muslim. Instead they decide to condemn TV shows like _24_.

> Groups like Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) and Muslim Public Affairs Council (MPAC) have a track record of condemning â€” but only targets like the Fox television show &#8220;24,&#8221; which they blasted earlier this year for having terrorists who were Muslims.
> 
> Never mind that CAIR officials have refused to condemn Hamas and Hezbollah when asked to do so by The Washington Post and others, describing questions about the terrorist groups as a &#8220;game.&#8221; And MPAC maintains, for example, that the Hezbollah murder of 241 Americans in Lebanon in 1983 was not a terrorist attack.

Yah, that really makes sense. Condemn Fox for staying mostly true for once to the way things are in the world. Kinda ironic. The entire article [can be read at the Washington Times][2].
