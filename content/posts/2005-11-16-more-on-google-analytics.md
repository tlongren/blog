I really like [Google Analytics][1] right off the bat. After getting to see some of the reports generated, I&#8217;m basically hooked. It just has an overall nice and pleasant way of showing what&#8217;s been happening on your site. I like the map, although I&#8217;d prefer an integrated Google Maps interface, instead of the Flash. But, there&#8217;s a lot of things that could really improve Google Analytics in my eyes.

Hopefully Google has some nice changes in store for Google Analytics, formerly Urchin, now that they&#8217;ve changed the name and have gone a totally different direction as far as marketing and product branding goes.

I don&#8217;t like the fact that the data used to generate the reports isn&#8217;t live. It took about 36 hours for any data to show up in my reports. And it took even longer for Analytics to realize I had installed the code on another site I had setup. I have no doubt they&#8217;re experiencing some pretty extreme server loads. Hopefully this is one of those things that will get better as the initial hype dies down. [Google Reader][2] was unusable for at least a couple days after it&#8217;s initial announcement. Performance got better after a couple days but didn&#8217;t improve enough for me to possibly use it as my every day feed reader.

One feature I&#8217;d really appreciate in Google Analytics would be the ability to export reports to PDF. I may have to try exporting one of the report pages to PDF in IE. I&#8217;m not sure if there&#8217;s a FireFox extension to create PDF&#8217;s from webpages.

I&#8217;m sorta surprised to see Google offer a free web reporting tool before they have a free live web stats package. Especially a tool like Urchin/Google Analytics, it&#8217;s got to have serious potential to make money. Maybe I&#8217;m wrong though, maybe that&#8217;s why the previous owners sold it to Google.

It&#8217;s gonna be useful to me no matter what. I&#8217;m excited to hopefully try it out on a few sites that make use of [AdWords][4]. There&#8217;s a lot of features in Google Analytics that are specifically for conversion tracking from AdWords and I believe Overture. All that&#8217;s involved is tagging links used in your search marketing campaigns and then letting Google Analytics know about those tags. That&#8217;s only if you use a paid search service other than AdWords. Google AdWords accounts automatically share conversion data with Analytics, provided the accounts are properly linked. There&#8217;s even a [URL builder][5] to assist in building tagged links for ads.

Should be fun.
