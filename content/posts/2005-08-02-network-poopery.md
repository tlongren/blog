Last Tuesday (July 26th), our network at work went totally down. Turned out a really old hub crapped out. Tuesday isn&#8217;t a good time for that to happen. It&#8217;s the last day that [Mom&#8217;s Meals][1] clients can call in orders for their next deliveries. In other words, it&#8217;s wicked busy. Ashley and her co-workers are busy entering the orders they&#8217;ve taken. Orders are of course entered into a database via a custom application.

They obviously can&#8217;t enter orders while the network is down. We were probably set back about 2 hours by the whole thing. Anyway, I quickly got a temporary network up so the girls could at least enter their orders. Then, after determining that the router wasn&#8217;t the cause, I removed one really old hub from the picture and things started looking better.

I headed off to staples to pick up a [Linksys EtherFastÂ® 4124 24-Port 10/100 Ethernet Switch][2]. Before we had this, some people&#8217;s pc&#8217;s were hooked into the router. Others were in that old hub. Now, the only cables going to the router come from the modem and go to the new Linksys switch. Two CAT-V cables going to the router, that&#8217;s it. What&#8217;s really nice is everyone is now on a 100Mbit network. And everyone is on the Linksys switch.

I also discarded a bunch of unused cables that didn&#8217;t seem to serve any purpose other than adding to the clutter. I wish we didn&#8217;t have to have all that stuff in the packing room. Ideally, it would be up here in the office _somewhere_. They wouldn&#8217;t get unplugged all the time if it was all up here.

Oh, I&#8217;m [claiming my feedster][3]. Dun bother clicking that link. And [one more time][4].
