I decided I&#8217;m not going to be voting next month. Why? Because I don&#8217;t want to. And because I&#8217;m sick of being pressured to vote. If any more of those fucks come up to me and ask if I&#8217;m registered and if I&#8217;ve voted yet, I will kill them&#8230;zero hesitation.

Who the fuck do these people think they are pressuring people to vote? If someone dun wanna vote, they don&#8217;t have to. I&#8217;ve had at least 5 encounters with these people. I can&#8217;t remember what organization they&#8217;re with, but I need to find out.

They don&#8217;t just ask if you&#8217;re registered to vote. They PRESSURE you to fill out absentee ballots while they stand there! One even offered to take it with her if I filled it out right then and there. If shit like this happens in 2008, I&#8217;m leaving the country.

Get a life you stupid ass holes. Quit forcing your opinions on other people! Our votes don&#8217;t matter anyway&#8230;ever heard of the Electoral College? Last I knew, the Electors weren&#8217;t required to vote the way their constituents vote. It&#8217;s suggested that they vote in favor of their constituents, but aren&#8217;t required to. So, in my opinion, it&#8217;s really up to the Electors in the Electoral College.

Democracy doesn&#8217;t _really_ exist here anymore.
