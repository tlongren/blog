Today is truly a sad day. As I was approaching 65 days uptime, the power went out. Now, I&#8217;m back down to zero. The last time I had rebooted the web server was when I compiled kernel 2.4.18 (the day of it&#8217;s release).

Hopefully 2.4.19 is released before I get another huge uptime and have to reboot again.
