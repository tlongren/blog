## A simple and easy to understand PHP MVC skeleton application {.subtitle}

While reading about the [&#8220;best&#8221; PHP frameworks of 2014][1] at SitePoint, I stumbled upon a [little framework][2] that will be very handy, especially where a full-blown framework may be a bit too much.

The PHP-MVC Project has two editions available, a basic version, and then an advanced version that supports Twig and automatic Saas compiling.

The developer of PHP-MVC was quoted in the SitePoint article, basically stating why he created it:

> Most frameworks are simply too advanced, making it hard for non-professional developers or frontend people to quickly build good things, so I was always searching for a naked and totally stripped-down PHP barebone application. php-mvc solves this problem and reduces the learning curve to a total time of under 30 minutes while still being very professional and self-explaining.

I&#8217;ll still probably use [Alto Router for really simple sites or apps][3], and [Slim Framework][4] for slightly larger sites.

I&#8217;ll probably never need to use the PHP-MVC skeleton application, but it&#8217;s nice to have available. PHP-MVC framework can be downloaded from GitHub, here&#8217;s [the basic version][5], and here&#8217;s [the advanced version][6].
