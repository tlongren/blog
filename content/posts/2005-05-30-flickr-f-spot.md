I finally got [F-Spot][1] to work. It was a dependancy problem as it turned out. I missed some errors that were spit out on the console when f-spot was loading my pictures. &#8220;Sysetm.DllNotFoundException: libexif.so.10&#8221;, that error specifically.

Turns out I had no libexif.so.10 file. Just a libexif.so.12 and libexif.so.9. So, I linked libexif.so.12 to libexif.so.10. Imported my photos back into f-spot and it generated thumbnails perfectly. Absolutely no errors on the console either, which is good. I&#8217;m happpy.

F-Spot is pretty awesome. What&#8217;s great about it is the fact that it tags your photos. So instead of searching for filenames or some other method, you give tags to your images to find them. Pretty much just like [Technorati Tags][2] . Tags are a big part of [Flickr][3] too.

Flickr is really sweet too. They&#8217;ve got a flash photo manager that&#8217;s pretty slick. It makes editing your photos titles, descriptions, and tags really easy. Although I noticed some lag on the actual changes showing up on [my photos page][4].

So far I&#8217;ve only played with it for about 20 minutes. F-Spot integrates nicely with Flickr. F-Spot sports the ability to export your photos to Flickr. It even exports your F-Spot tags to Flickr. I haven&#8217;t seen any photo management software for Windows as good as F-Spot. I really like it. It&#8217;s kick ass it&#8217;s a native Gnome app. I believe it&#8217;s going to be shipped as a part of Gnome at some point.
