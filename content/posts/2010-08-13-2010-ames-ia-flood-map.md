[David Runneals][1] put together [a nice map][2] with lots of info about the [flooding in Ames, IA][3].

I managed to take quite a few photos around Ames and Nevada, you can find them in [this set on Flickr][4]. There are [currently][5] [four][6] [panoramas][7] [that][8] do a pretty good job of showing how much water there was on the East side of Ames.

The Ames Tribune has [a PDF][9] with some really cool aerial shots, it&#8217;s worth checking out.
