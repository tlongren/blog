Saw this via [Take Back the News][1]:

> Microsoft Corp. has been highly secretive about whether it will release its next Xbox video-game console this year or next. Apparently, Bill Gates didn&#8217;t get the memo.
> 
> Speaking yesterday to a national convention of business editors and writers, the Microsoft chairman seemed to confirm widespread industry speculation about the timing of the release, referring to plans to ship the console &#8220;this year.&#8221;
> 
> The remark, apparently inadvertent, came as Gates talked about consumer adoption of high-definition displays, which Microsoft is incorporating into its strategy as it takes on market leader Sony Corp. and its dominant PlayStation franchise.

That&#8217;s awesome! I smell another Christmas release. Hope I have enough money later on in the year to pick one up.
