If I was going to vote, I&#8217;d now vote in favor of Kerry. One reason and one reason alone. His stance on stem cell research. It&#8217;s my belief that he would allow the harvesting of new stem cells to benefit medical research.

Mr. Bush made it illegal to harvest new stem cells. Leaving researchers only the &#8220;left over&#8221; stem cells to work with. Once the left overs are gone, legal stem cell research is done in the U.S.

Stem cells can be applied to so many aspects of medical science. They&#8217;ll be an integral part of finding cures for diseases for the next many years.
