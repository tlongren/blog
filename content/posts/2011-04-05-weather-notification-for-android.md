I hate WeatherBug. I have never used it on a PC, have never used their website (I&#8217;m a wunderground loyalist). However, I did install it on my Motorola Defy for a while. One feature I enjoyed was the temp and current conditions being displayed in the status bar.

WeatherBug was too bloated for me to justify keeping it around for that feature alone. That&#8217;s where [Weather Notification by Denis Nelubin][1] comes in.

Weather Notification for Android does exactly what I want. Even better, it&#8217;s extremely easy on battery (unlike WeatherBug). And another plus is that the code is [available on Google Code][2]! The code is available under the [GNU GPL V2][3] license.

Now, the version of Weather Notification available in the Android Market (0.1.2-beta1) puts the weather information in the &#8220;Notifications&#8221; section of the status bar. I contacted Denis (the developer) about the possibility of moving the weather info from &#8220;Notifications&#8221; to &#8220;Ongoing&#8221;. He said he&#8217;s had other requests for that same thing, and has released a version (0.1.3-beta1) that does just that, moves the weather info from &#8220;Notifications&#8221; to &#8220;Ongoing&#8221;.

You can find [Weather Notification 0.1.3-beta1 at Google Code][4]. Denis has some other features planned for Weather Notification before it gets an update in the Android Market. But in the meantime you can grab the latest version from [the Google Code repo][2]. Or, if you don&#8217;t care where the weather info is shown, grab [version 0.1.2-beta1 from the Android Market][1].

You can also scan the QR code below to get Weather Notification from the Android Market.
