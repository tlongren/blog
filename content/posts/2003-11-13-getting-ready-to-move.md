We&#8217;re getting ready to move the office from Des Moines to Chicago. Thursday night we&#8217;ll be loading the 24&#8242; U-Haul. Friday morning Jeremy is planning to drive to Chicago in his car for meetings all day. Friday night Josh and I are going to drive the U-Haul to the office in Chicago.

We&#8217;ll spend all Saturday and most of Sunday setting up the office. We&#8217;ve got to install the raised flooring and get the rack server cabinets put back together and set up. We&#8217;ll probably lay some new carpet and shorten one of the counters along one of the walls too.

We&#8217;ll go back to Chicago on Dec. 1. At that point we&#8217;ll start getting servers set up and work on getting the internet connection working (I think we&#8217;re getting one full DS-3 to start off with).
