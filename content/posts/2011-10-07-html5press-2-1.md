HTML5Press 2.1 is available for download from the [HTML5Press page][1]. You can see a [detailed list of all the changes][2] between 2.0 and 2.1 [on Github][3].

There were three major additions to HTML5Press 2.1, including [fuzzy timestamps][4], a built-in Twitter widget, and support for WordPress custom backgrounds. [Gregory C][5] left [a comment a few days ago][6] that made me decide to add support for WordPress custom backgrounds. It was a simple enough thing to add, not sure why I didn&#8217;t add support for custom backgrounds earlier.  
[ad]  
The featured photo for this post is just a screenshot of the Twitter widget options. That widget may look familiar to you. It&#8217;s nothing but a slightly modified version of [Simple Twitter Widget][7] by [Matthias Siegal][8]. I made some modifications to his plugin to include the HTML5 time element and to also make use of timeago for fuzzy timestamps.

Fuzzy timestamps are global in HTML5Press. Dates/times on posts, pages, comments, and the twitter widget will all be shown as fuzzy timestamps instead of the actual date/time. Mousing over the fuzzy timestamp will reveal the true date/time.

Some other, more minor changes and fixes:

  * [Fix the Allerta font][9], it was pulling the wrong font from Google
  * [Include the lightbox effect on gallery images][10] and include them as a set
  * [Remove HTML5Press options from Appearance menu][11] and give it it&#8217;s own menu.

You can download HTML5Press 2.1 from the [HTML5Press page][1] or from [Github][12]. If you notice anything broken or have any other problems, please [start an issue at Github][13].
