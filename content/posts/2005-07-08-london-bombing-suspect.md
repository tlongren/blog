I saw this via [Say Anything][1]. Even if it wasn&#8217;t him, it&#8217;s great to see they&#8217;ve got leads already. The Indepundit has updates and a little bio type thing on Mohamed Guerbouzi. 

> A Brussels-based European police official said British police have asked their European counterparts for information on a Moroccan man, Mohamed Guerbouzi, in relation to the attacks in London.
> 
> Mr. Guerbouzi has been under investigation in Britain in connection with two previous attacks, a 2003 suicide bombing in Morocco and last year&#8217;s attack on commuter trains in Spain. Mr. Guerbouzi held a senior position in the Moroccan Islamic Combatant Group, or GICM, investigators say. He has been living in Britain for about a decade, the police official said on condition of anonymity. It is unclear if he is in British police custody.

[  
The Counterterrorism Blog][2] would probably be a good place for updates on this. [Michelle Malkin][3] has a lot of really good stuff on this guy and some related commentary and linkage.

Almost forgot, [The Indepundit][4] has a little bio on this guy from &#8220;[The Terrorism Knowledge Base][5]&#8220;. Apparently this guy was also being looked at in connection with the Madrid bombings.
