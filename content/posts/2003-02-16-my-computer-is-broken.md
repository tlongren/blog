My main desktop computer is broken. The power went out while I was away from home this weekend. I think one of the hard drives may have been fried.

I&#8217;ll probably just install a fresh copy of Slackware-Current as soon as I get it downloaded. I&#8217;m currently downloading it at around 150kb/sec from the PSU mirror. Hopefully it will be fixed soon. 

<div class="wpulike wpulike-default " >
  <div class="wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked">
    <button type="button"
					aria-label="Like Button"
					data-ulike-id="1554"
					data-ulike-nonce="e8a2d67804"
					data-ulike-type="likeThis"
					data-ulike-template="wpulike-default"
					data-ulike-display-likers="0"
					data-ulike-disable-pophover="0"
					class="wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_likethis_1554"></button><span class="count-box"></span>
