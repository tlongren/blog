Here&#8217;s a list of my [WordPress][1] related projects.

### 1. [Rootdip Theme][2]

> Rootdip (formerly HTML5Press) is a WordPress theme based on the [HTML5 template by Jesper][3].

### 2. [WordPress Child Theme Example][4]

> If you&#8217;re not using Independent Publisher for your theme, you&#8217;ll want to fork this repo and modify it to fit your theme. If you are using Independent Publisher theme, just download this repo, upload it to WordPress, activate it in the dashboard, and you&#8217;ll have schema.org markup. Created as a compliment to [this post][5].

### 3. [Thumbnail Viewer Plugin][6]

> [Thumbnail Viewer plugin for WordPress][6] is simply used to overlay images on a page, similar to Lightbox JS. The javascript is from the Image Thumbnail Viewer code from DynamicDrive. The javascript included in Thumbnail Viewer from [DynamicDrive][7] is much faster than Lightbox JS, although not as feature packed, which is the entire point.

### 4. [Unwakeable Theme][8]

> [Unwakeable][8] is a theme based off [K2][9] and [Unsleepable][10]. Unwakeable has built-in [support for numerous plugins][11].

<div class="wpulike wpulike-default " >
  <div class="wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked">
    <button type="button"
					aria-label="Like Button"
					data-ulike-id="2321"
					data-ulike-nonce="d992a47e87"
					data-ulike-type="likeThis"
					data-ulike-template="wpulike-default"
					data-ulike-display-likers="0"
					data-ulike-disable-pophover="0"
					class="wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_likethis_2321"></button><span class="count-box"></span>
  </div>
