I was gonna go out and try to snag a copy of Halo 2 lastnight. Got to be about 11:30 and I just said fuck it and went to bed. I figured there&#8217;d prolly be huge lines at Hastings in Ames. I know a lot of people called in and reserved copies&#8230;so there prolly wasn&#8217;t any copies that weren&#8217;t spoken for already.

I am gonna go today after work to try to get a copy. I&#8217;m also gonna return that piece of shit controller I bought from Hastings a couple weeks ago. I played one level in Halo with it then set it down. Next day, I picked it up to play some more and it just didn&#8217;t work at all.

Oh well, I&#8217;m just glad Halo 2 is out now:
