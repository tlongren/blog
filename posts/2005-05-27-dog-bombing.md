Be warned, I drop the f-bomb _very_ readily and multiple times in this post. Don&#8217;t read if you&#8217;re easily offended.

God, this is asenine. Seems the bad guys in Iraq have pretty much run out of suicide bombing volunteers. What the hell are they to do now? Duh, just strap some explosives to a dog and let him go! Seems like a pretty obvious solution.

You fucking pussies should just start doing the suicide bombings yourself. Stop using children, stop using animals. Just do it your damn selves if it&#8217;s so important to you. Or better yet, find another way to kill and maim. Why the fuck does it have to involve some living creature with explosives tied to it? That&#8217;s really fucked up. If they were smart, wouldn&#8217;t they come up with some sort of strategy? This just goes to show the mind set of the people we&#8217;re fighting. They have the inability to reason and make rational decisions. 

I&#8217;m almost slipping back into the mindset that we should just nuke the whole entire region. I don&#8217;t see why we shouldn&#8217;t use the same principles they use. 

Rusty, at [The Jawa Report][1], brings up a good point in saying &#8220;Where is PETA when they&#8217;re really needed?&#8221;.

> Insurgents in Iraq attached explosives to a dog and tried to blow up a military convoy near the northern oil centre of Kirkuk.
> 
> The canine bomb went off but the only casualty was the unfortunate animal, said police. The militants wrapped an explosive belt around the dog and detonated it as the convoy passed through Dakuk, 25 miles south of Kirkuk, said the town&#8217;s police chief, Col Mohammed Barzaji.
> 
> &#8220;The dog was torn apart by the explosion which caused neither injury among the soldiers nor any damage.&#8221; 

You can read the rest of the [story at the Telegraph][2]. That&#8217;s pretty messed up they&#8217;re using dogs.
