This about made me sick to read. First thing that popped into my mind was communist China and a certain town sqaure there.

Two tanks were deployed in the city of Los Angeles yesterday to counter a peaceful anti-war protest. The 1st amendment gives people freedom of expression. Freedom of expression consists of the rights to freedom of speech, press, assembly and to petition.

There&#8217;s been almost no media coverage of this by any of the major news outlets.  
Even worse&#8230;It&#8217;s my opinion, that sending tanks to disrupt a peaceful anti-war protest is directly against the 1st amendment. I believe it guarantees (well, not in this case) freedom of expression. And freedom of expression includes freedom of speech, press, assembly and freedom to petition.

Here&#8217;s a link to the original story:

There were a couple follow up articles, but I can&#8217;t seem to find the links to them at moment. When I dig em up I&#8217;ll post a comment to this entry with them.
