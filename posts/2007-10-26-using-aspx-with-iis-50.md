I&#8217;m posting this here mostly so I can refer back to it later if I ever have the need to. I recently had to setup a Windows server running IIS 5.0 at work. It will be hosting a web application that will be used to verify all orders.  
<!--adsense-->

  
Anyway, I had IIS up and running but couldn&#8217;t get it to execute pages with a .aspx extension. It would just offer up the .aspx file for download instead of executing it and displaying in the browser. Turns out this is due to the ASP.NET ISAPI extension not being registered with IIS. To register the extension with IIS, open a command prompt and issue the following commands:

  1. cd C:winntMicrosoft.NetFrameworkv2.0.50727
  2. aspnet_regiis -i

In that example, I registered the ASP.NET 2.0 framework with IIS. If you want to use a different version of .NET, replace **v2.0.50727** with whatever version you want to use. The various versions installed will be listed in the C:winntMicrosoft.NetFramework folder.

After running the **apsnet_regiis** command, my .aspx files loaded right away. I discovered all this at the [Channel9 MSDN forums][1]. 

<div class="wpulike wpulike-default " >
  <div class="wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked">
    <button type="button"

					data-ulike-nonce="ce99a9f696"
					data-ulike-type="likeThis"
					data-ulike-template="wpulike-default"
					data-ulike-display-likers="0"
					data-ulike-disable-pophover="0"
					class="wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_likethis_2336"></button><span class="count-box"></span>
  </div>
