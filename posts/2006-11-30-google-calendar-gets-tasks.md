Sort of. I read [this over on Ajaxian yesterday][1] but didn&#8217;t get a chance to check it out until this morning. The folks over at [Remember The Milk][2] have taken notice of the fact that a great number of their users are [using Google Calendar to keep track of events][3], while continuing to use Remember The Milk for daily tasks. So, the fine people at Remember The Milk have come out with Remember The Milk for Google Calendar:

> We know that many of you are managing your tasks with Remember The Milk and your events with [Google Calendar][4], and we thought it would be very cool if we could bring the two together. This new feature adds a small task icon to the top of each day in Google Calendar &#8212; click on the icon to:
> 
>   * Review your tasks for the day
>   * Add new tasks and edit existing ones
>   * Easily complete and postpone tasks
>   * Review your overdue tasks
>   * Optionally show tasks with no due date
>   * See where your tasks are located on a map

This exciting for me. I&#8217;ve been waiting on Google to add official tasks to Google Calendar, but this will suffice. Actually, I like this because I really enjoy using Remember The Milk, and would like to continue using it. Looks like I&#8217;ll be able to keep using it indefinitely now that RTM has support for Google Calendar. Yay!!
