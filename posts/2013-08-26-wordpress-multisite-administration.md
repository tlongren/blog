[WordPress Multisite Administration is avaialable for pre-order][1] from packtpub.com. I won&#8217;t go into the details of the book here, [I&#8217;ve touched on it previously][2]. [Packt][3] will be publishing WordPress Multisite Administration tomorrow (maybe it&#8217;s _today_ now), Monday August 26.

A few days ago the folks at Packt sent me over the book cover for approval, there&#8217;s a copy of the book cover attached to this post. My daughter Sydney really liked it, and I didn&#8217;t see any reason to argue with her.

I&#8217;ll have a few books to give away, am not sure if I&#8217;ll be doing that on this blog, on Twitter, Google+, or what. Either way I&#8217;ll post something about the book giveaway here. I think I&#8217;ll have 3 physical books and 1 ebook to giveaway right away after publication.

I really enjoyed working with the technical editors, who gave great advice throughout the editing process. And, as I suspect is normal, the people at Packt were all wonderful to work with. Communication was great and I think I was able to deliver everything on deadline, if not before. Although there may have been a couple times I had to ask for an extra day or two, which they were always willing to happily accommodate. It was laid-back and just generally a fun experience.

In a month or two I should have news on another book. It&#8217;ll be another WordPress book most likely, but could possibly be about one of the newer, more design focused CMS offerings, which there are _lots_ of these days.
