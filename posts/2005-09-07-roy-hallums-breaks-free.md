Well, he may not have broken free, but he&#8217;s [no longer a hostage][1]. He was taken hostage on November 1st, 2004 by a group of insurgents in Iraq. The Jawa Report was [the first media outlet][2] to report that Roy had been taken hostage. Since then Rusty and the guys at the Jawa Report have done all they can to help the Hallums family. They helped by raising money and keeping his name in the media. Keeping ones name in the news would seem to be almost more important than any money that could be raised. Things happen when the media pays attention.

Yah, needless to say Rusty is freakin elated at this news as a lot of use are. Rusty even more so than most I&#8217;d imagine. 

**UPDATE:** Rusty now [has a response][3] from the Hallums family confirming that Roy truly has been freed and they&#8217;re on their way to see him right now. That&#8217;s amazing.
