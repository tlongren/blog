Supposedly, a wedding was taking place in a banquet hall inside one of the hotels. There [was some speculation][3] over wether or not the bombs were pre-planted or if this was the result of suicide bombers. It seems to be generally accepted now that it was suicide bombers.

Could this somehow be related to or in response to the Paris riots? Could be, but I doubt it. Proabably just more islamic crazies blowing stuff up for the sake of blowing stuff up. And to murder as many zionist pigs as possible, which is usually their goal. Note I said &#8220;usually&#8221;, not &#8220;always&#8221;. And I said &#8220;islamic crazies&#8221; rather than &#8220;all muslims&#8221;. You [liberal][4] [european][5] bloggers can stop calling me islamaphobic now.

**UPDATE 1:** [Wizbang][16] has an update stating that [FoxNews][17] is reporting the death toll has risen to 57 with [115 people injured][18]. Apparently the bombs at the Radisson and the Hyatt were suicide bombers. The Days Inn explosion was caused by a car bomb.

**UPDATE 2:** [FoxNews][17] is now reporting the number of injuries to be closer to 300 than 115.
