The WordPress folks have a limited amount of [WordPress and WordCamp t-shirts][1] available for sale. These t-shirts are the first edition. They&#8217;re planning on coming up with different styles in the future to represent specific times in WordPress history. The t-shirts they have available are the first style available.

> Part of the idea is once we print a style, we never do it again, so each shirt will be representative of a certain time in WordPress history. Since these are the very first, they make a great gift for yourself or that special blogging geek in you life.

You can [go to the store][2] to get your WordPress or WordCamp t-shirts, providing there&#8217;s still some available. Mine should be here by Tuesday.
