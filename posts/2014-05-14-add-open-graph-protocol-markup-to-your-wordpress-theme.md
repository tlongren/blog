## Rich objects in a social graphs {.subtitle}

When you share a link on Facebook, an image from the link is shown, usually. Sometimes, no image is displayed, as if Facebook couldn&#8217;t find a suitable image at the URL.

### Why?

Adding [Open Graph protocol][1] tags to your site will ensure that Facebook knows which image to use when someone shares a page on your website. Open Graph markup is similar to [schema.org markup][2]. Both allow you to define values for certain aspects of your website, as seen by other sites like Facebook, Twitter, and many other social media sites.

### How?

There&#8217;s a couple of ways we can do this. You can use a plugin, like [Open Graph Protocol Framework][3], or you can add Open Graph markup to your WordPress theme manually.

We&#8217;ll be covering how to add Open Graph markup to your theme manually. Especially useful for theme developers who want to build Open Graph protocol support into their themes.

The markup we&#8217;ll be adding can be seen in [this GitHub gist][4]:

<div class="oembed-gist">
  <noscript>
    View the code on <a href="https://gist.github.com/tlongren/e9e2316fa95b50cbed38">Gist</a>.
  </noscript>
</div>

Most of that should be pretty self-explanatory.

The `og:type` property is the only tag that needs explanation, as there&#8217;s only certain values that are valid. Most of the time, you&#8217;ll probably be setting the `og:type` property to `article` or `website`. A [list of other Open Graph protocol object types][5] can be found at the [Open Graph protocol site][5].

### The Code

Every Open Graph property will be set on-the-fly, depending on which post or page is being viewed or shared. To add the necessary markup, we need to use the [add_action][6] WordPress function inside your theme&#8217;s `functions.php` file. Here&#8217;s how I&#8217;ve been handing it:

<div class="oembed-gist">
  <noscript>
    View the code on <a href="https://gist.github.com/tlongren/de3f80c5f0b54a01e24f">Gist</a>.
  </noscript>
</div>

<div class="wpulike wpulike-default " >
  <div class="wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked">
    <button type="button"
					aria-label="Like Button"
					data-ulike-id="5922"
					data-ulike-nonce="f320672b83"
					data-ulike-type="likeThis"
					data-ulike-template="wpulike-default"
					data-ulike-display-likers="0"
					data-ulike-disable-pophover="0"
					class="wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_likethis_5922"></button><span class="count-box">1+</span>
  </div>
</div>
