I don&#8217;t really like this theme anymore. I feel limited by it somehow. I will be switching themes off and on for the next few weeks maybe. Trying to find something I like and that&#8217;s highly adaptable.

I really, really like the [White as Milk][1] theme just because it&#8217;s so clean and simple. I alread used that for the [official Purfoods website][2] though.

The [Zen Minimalist theme][3] is also quite appealing to me, along with the [Oxymod theme][4].

Really though, I think I&#8217;ll end up going with a modified version of the [Identification Bands theme][5]. The two column version. The only thing I don&#8217;t like about that theme is the image for the background. I&#8217;m probably gonna modify that theme to make it a little &#8220;less&#8221; what it is. The blue doesn&#8217;t really appeal to me as it makes text in textareas hard to read.

Anyway, it&#8217;s gonna be one of the themes listed above, assuming I don&#8217;t come across something else. The theme I&#8217;m currently using take a little too long to load. I&#8217;m mostly looking to have a plainer theme and improved loading times. 

<div class="wpulike wpulike-default " >
  <div class="wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked">
    <button type="button"
					aria-label="Like Button"
					data-ulike-id="1962"
					data-ulike-nonce="94d646ed14"
					data-ulike-type="likeThis"
					data-ulike-template="wpulike-default"
					data-ulike-display-likers="0"
					data-ulike-disable-pophover="0"
					class="wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_likethis_1962"></button><span class="count-box"></span>
  </div>
