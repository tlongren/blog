[The FEDERATED MySQL storage engine][1] is the coolest thing EVER! Seriously. It&#8217;s already saved me from having to do a whole bunch of synchronization coding. I can only imagine how it&#8217;ll come in useful in the future.

So, here&#8217;s my situation. I have two mysql servers sitting behind a firewall at &#8220;location 1&#8221;. People at &#8220;location 2&#8221; need to write some software to connect to both mysql servers at location 1. However, [MyODBC][2] gets confused when connecting to the same hostname on two different tcp ports, or so I&#8217;m told.

Anyway, since I was basically told that there&#8217;s no way to connect to two seperate mysql servers behind one firewall, I got to thinking. So, I set off searching google for method for mirroring data in MySQL and came across [the FEDERATED storage engine][1].

Now, the servers at location 1 are on a VPN with the network at location 3, my location. So, my network (at location 3) can see the network at location 1 without the firewall getting in the way. Since that&#8217;s the case here, I can connect to the default mysql port, 3306, on both servers because I can see their LAN IP, where the people at location 2 can&#8217;t (no VPN).

So, we&#8217;ve got the network flow figured out, now we can go about getting the FEDERATED storage engine in MySQL working. First, you&#8217;ll need [MySQL 5.x][3]. I chose MySQL 5.0.24 as it&#8217;s the latest stable 5.x release.

To enable the FEDERATED storage engine in mysql 5, you must pass the **&#8211;with-federated-storage-engine** option when running configure. That&#8217;s pretty much all that&#8217;s required to start using the FEDERATED storage engine. Most linux distributions probably have a mysql 5 package that comes with the FEDERATED engine on already, although Slackware does not currently.<!--more-->

  
<!--adsense-->

  
After you build mysql to support the FEDERATED storage engine, there&#8217;s really very little left to do to start making use of it. First you&#8217;ll need the table structure of the table you want to link to. We&#8217;ll use a table named &#8220;customers&#8221; as an example, with 3 fields, custId, fName, lName. The SQL used to build the initial &#8220;customers&#8221; table is below. The &#8220;customers&#8221; table is in the &#8220;companyData&#8221; database on the 192.168.1.248 MySQL server.

<pre>CREATE TABLE `customers` (
	`custId` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL default '0',
	`fName` varchar(100) default NULL,
	`lName` varchar(100) default NULL,
	PRIMARY KEY  (`custId`)
)
ENGINE=InnoDB
DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1;</pre>

A pretty simple and very basic table setup. Now, the SQL above is the SQL that&#8217;s used to generate the original table, the one that is actually storing all the data. To create a FEDERATED table that links to the original customers table, we use basically the same SQL, except we need to change a few things on the last couple lines:

<pre>CREATE TABLE `customers` (
	`custId` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL default '0',
	`fName` varchar(100) default NULL,
	`lName` varchar(100) default NULL,
	PRIMARY KEY  (`custId`)
)
ENGINE=FEDERATED
DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1
CONNECTION='mysql://mysqluser:mysqlpass@192.168.1.248:3306/companyData/customers';</pre>

See the last line there, the one starting with CONNECTION? That&#8217;s the real important one. It tells the new FEDERATED table where it needs to link to to get it&#8217;s data. The format of the CONNECTION clause is:

<pre>scheme://user_name[:password]@host_name[:port_num]/db_name/tbl_name</pre>

Pretty simple. You can read more about the FEDERATED storage engine [in the MySQL reference manual][4]. There&#8217;s also [a support forum dedicated][5] to the FEDERATED storage engine, as well as a [nice article over at the MySQL developer zone][6].
