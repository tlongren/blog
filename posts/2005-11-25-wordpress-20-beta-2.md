WordPress 2.0 Beta 2 is out now. I upgraded yesterday while I was at home. I fucked up my wordpress database a little earlier this morning. Had to revert back to a slightly older database to get WordPress back to functional state.

Some pretty weird shit has been going on around here lately. A [new PHP version][1] is [out][2], which seems to totally kill WordPress.

[Mint 1.23][3] is out. I upgraded recently from the previous stable version, 1.14. The upgrade hasn&#8217;t exactly gone well. My stats aren&#8217;t updating at all. Waiting on a resolution for this still.

There&#8217;s supposed to be a new version of this [WordPress theme out soon][4]. Hari will be updating the theme to fix the sidebar issue in Internet Explorer. He seems to think he&#8217;s got a fix in place already.

I&#8217;ll be blogging regularly again this weekend, hopefully tonight once I get all these little issues worked out. There&#8217;s been a lot going on that I need to catch up on.
