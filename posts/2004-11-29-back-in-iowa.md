Ashley and I got back home to Iowa lastnight around 5:00. It was an unusually long drive home. Traffic was horrible. Nobody was driving in the right lane, every mother fucker was in the fast lane&#8230;.and they were going about 68mph. It got frustrating.

Lots of cops out yesterday too. We saw probably about 20 of them or so. Luckily they all had people pulled over by the time we got to them.

Ashley and I had a good time in Wisconsin. We went to see _Alexander_ on Friday night. It was weird, that&#8217;s about all i can say about it. The battle scenes were pretty cool though.

I woke up this morning here to see snow on the ground. It&#8217;s freakin cold here! I had major troubles getting out of bed this morning. We went out to a bar lastnight till about 10:00, so that could have something to do with it. Not to mention we had drinks every night while in Wisconsin.

It was a good time. Thanksgiving dinner was great. [Wanderlust Coffee Gallery][1] kicks ass. I think Ashley and I went there about every morning to get some drinks. They got kick ass croissants there too!

Well, I gotta get back to work.
