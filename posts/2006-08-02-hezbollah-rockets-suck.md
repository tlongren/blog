Apparently the rockets possessed by Hezbollah are quite shabby, they miss their targets quite often, but that isn&#8217;t really the point of this post. [This Sandmonkey poses some really great and insightful questions][1] to people of all ethnic backgrounds concerning the ongoing fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, in Lebanon.

> Impressed by this point of view that I haven&#8217;t considerd before, I asked him what he would&#8217;ve thought, if a Hezbollah rocket had attacked a building in Israel, killing 55 civillians, of which 30 were children. He responded immeidtely &#8220;I would&#8217;ve thought it was great! A7san!&#8221;.
> 
> So I repeated the same question to 8 other co-workers, and the responses so far have been as follows: 7 said they would celebrate, and 2 said that such an attack would&#8217;ve been bad, but justified! Yeah! Not a single person said that the death of any civllian, on either side, is an equal tragedy. Civillians dead on our side is tragic, civillian deaths on their side cause for celebration. And if you think I am being unfair or demonizing arabs or whatever, do me a favor and try it at your work place and/or with members of your family. Conduct this little social experiment and see for yourself. The results are very interesting.

There&#8217;s an [extensive][2] [list][3] [of][4] very well thought out comments to read through too. As you can imagine, some comments are quite heated.

**UPDATE:**  
Now, [Sandmonkey has been slandered][5] in a [BBC-Arabic article][6]. The author of the BBC article says:

> The owner of the famous Sandmonkey blog, who published a Poem that encoruages Israel to flatten Hezbollah a couple of days ago, has said that Israel has encouraged a new generation of arab liberal to hate it.

The BBC article author flat out lied in his article, saying Sandmonkey published a poem encouraging Israel to flatten Hezbollah. That&#8217;s not the impression I got from the &#8220;[Some slightly uncomfortable questions][1]&#8221; post. I think that BBC author has gotten himself in more trouble than he probably knows. I think Sandmonkey is contemplating suing for libel. I hope he does.
