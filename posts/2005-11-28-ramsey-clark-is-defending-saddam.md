H/T to Jay over at [Stop the ACLU][1] for the good word early this morning. Too bad I&#8217;m a lazy ass, posting 13 hours after the fact. We (errr, I) should for sure be back into the swing of things by tomorrow around here.

Ramsey Clark, the guy that defended ole [Slobodan Milosevic][2], AKA &#8220;Sloppy-Joe Missle-Bitch&#8221;, will be seated next to Saddam Hussein through the rest of his trial. That is, assuming he [doesn&#8217;t get whacked][3], which wouldn&#8217;t be all bad. From the [BBC][4]:

> Former US attorney general Ramsey Clark, an outspoken critic of the trial, was seated alongside the defence team.
> 
> Mr Clark, 77, who flew in from the Jordanian capital Amman on Sunday, said he wanted to protect Saddam Hussein‚Äôs rights.
> 
> ‚ÄúA fair trial in this case is absolutely imperative for historical truth,‚Äù he told Reuters news agency.
> 
> The left-wing activist, who held office in the 1960s under President Lyndon Johnson, has previously described the special tribunal as a creation of the US military occupation.

What the fuck Clark? Saddam murdered thousands of people, and you want to make sure _his_ rights, of all peoples, aren&#8217;t violated. I think Ramsey Clark just qualified himself for the &#8220;_Douche Bag of the Year &#8211; 2006_&#8221; award. Clark shouldn&#8217;t be allowed back into the U.S. He&#8217;s a freakin &#8220;enemy combatant&#8221; as far as I can tell. [Jay][1] has some to add:

> Mr. Clark doesn‚Äôt have that great of a success record, but he has a long history as an international lawyer practicing his favorite pastime, America bashing, and defending America‚Äôs enemies. In 1985, the former Chairman of the National Advisory Counsel of the ACLU, filed a multimillion dollar lawsuit against his own country while defending Libya‚Äôs dictator, Qadaffi. In 1980, in the midst of the Iranian Hostage Crisis Ramsey flew to Tehran not to help the US hostages but to take part in a ‚ÄúCrimes in America‚Äù symposium.

Who the hell would sue their own country on behalf of another country? Stupid question I guess. [The Washington Post][5] has an article about Saddam&#8217;s defiance today. Other blogs on the subject:
