I heard that Paris Hilton&#8217;s notebook got stolen. It supposedly had a bunch of videos of her on it or something. I&#8217;m not even sure if it got stolen or is just missing. Anyway, Paris was hatin on bloggers in a recent interview she did. By way of [SearchViews][1].

> Talking tech is fun, but even more so when celebs get in on the act. First up is Paris Hilton, who in a [recent interview][2] admitted her complete and utter ignorance of blogosphere:
> 
> **Reporter**: Do you read blogs?  
> **Paris**: What&#8217;s that?  
> **Reporter**: Um, they&#8217;re these things on the Internet where people write about news and stuff.  
> **Paris**: No, I don&#8217;t really read anything on the Internet except my AOL mail. I don&#8217;t like people who sit on computers all day long and write about people they don&#8217;t know anything about.
> 
> You tell &#8217;em, Paris. While you&#8217;re at it, try to take better care of your electronic equipment. First the Sidekick gets hacked, now we get word that your laptop has been lost. Guess she&#8217;s in the midst of a move-in with her boyfriend of the same name and, according to her publicist, &#8220;A lot of stuff is in flux.&#8221;

I had to laugh when I read that. She&#8217;s so retarded. Her new movie, House of Wax looks really stupid. I&#8217;ve never seen the 1953 original, but I&#8217;d imagine it&#8217;s better than the one that&#8217;s coming out tomorrow. I wish she would go away.
