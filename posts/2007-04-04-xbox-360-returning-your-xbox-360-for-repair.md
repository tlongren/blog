Lots of people have been coming here searching for information about sending their Xbox 360 in to Microsoft for repair. My Xbox 360 is on it&#8217;s way back to me from being repaired, so I figured I&#8217;d post my experience with the repair process.

On March 24th, 2007 I contacted Microsoft Xbox customer support and was able to get the repair process started. My Xbox 360 was still suffering from the dreaded 3 red lights on the Ring Of Light at that time.

Upon initiatiating the repair process, I received an email from Microsoft confirming the repair process had begun. The email stated that I would receive another email once the next step in the repair process begins:

> Dear Xbox Customer:
> 
> Thank you for contacting Xbox Customer Care. We have received your request for service. Please prepare your console and follow the instructions provided by our customer service department. You will receive an e-mail as soon as the next step in the process has begun.
> 
> Thank you,  
> Xbox Customer Care

The support agent I spoke with gave detailed instructions on what information to include in the box I returned my Xbox 360 in. I typed all the information out, printed it, and put it right on top of my Xbox 360 inside the box I shipped it in. **Include this information when returning your Xbox 360 for repair**:

  1. Support Reference # (provided by Xbox support agent).
  2. Xbox 360 serial number (from the back of your console).
  3. Your name.
  4. Your return shipping address.

It&#8217;s important that you **DO NOT SEND YOUR HARD DRIVE, CONTROLLERS, OR MEMORY CARDS!** If you send them in with your console you will probably never see them again. Make sure there&#8217;s not a game in the DVD drive. Take your hard drive off and make sure all memory cards are out before packing your Xbox 360 up. All you want to send in is your bare Xbox 360 console.

Once you have your Xbox 360 all packaged up along with the necessary information, you&#8217;re ready to ship. There seems to be quite a bit of confusion exactly where to send your Xbox 360 for repair. There&#8217;s lots of confusion because many of the Xbox support agents don&#8217;t speak english as their native language. It&#8217;s hard to understand a mailing address from someone with a thick Spanish accent. Now, I&#8217;m sure Microsoft has more than one repair center, so make sure to pay close attention when the agent gives you the address to send your Xbox 360 to. I was told to send my Xbox 360 to the following address, your support agent may provide you with a different address:

> Repair Center  
> 5700 South International Parkway  
> Door #18  
> McAllen, TX 78503

I just took my box to my local post office to ship. I shipped it using the Priority Mail service and purchased $200 worth of insurance coverage for $3.35. Total came to be about $18. Only took 4 days to get there, and that&#8217;s counting the weekend. Once they received the package at the repair center I got the following email:

> Dear Customer,
> 
> We have received your Xbox at our service center. It is our priority to process your Xbox in a timely manner and to get it back to you as good as new. We will contact you as soon as we are finished so you can get ready to get back into the game!
> 
> Thanks,  
> Xbox Customer Care

Exactly two hours later, I got another email stating that my Xbox 360 had been fixed and was on it&#8217;s way home. The email said my Xbox 360 should be here in 2 to 5 days, it&#8217;d be great to have it before this weekend. They even gave me a UPS tracking number, but there&#8217;s nothing there other than a confirmation that the return shipping has been paid for. Hopefully some real tracking data will show up on it tomorrow.
