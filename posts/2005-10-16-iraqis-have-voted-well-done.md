Iraqis voted on their Constitution yesterday. The voting appeared to go fairly well with not much happening to distract people from participating. It&#8217;s estimated that 15.5 million Iraqis headed to the polls to cast their simple &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;no&#8221; ballot.

[The Political Teen][1] has a video explaining what the requirements are for the Constitution to pass. Apparently the New York Times and the Washington Post printed some pretty conflicting articles about the iraq constitution vote. [The Moderate Voice][2] has more on that. The votes are still being counted though, it&#8217;s stupid to speculate when it could be weeks before all the votes are tallied. I feel like speculating too though I guess, so I speculate the Constitution will pass. The Sunnis were opposed to the poll in January, sounds like some of them have been brought around and at least participated, maybe even voted yes.

[Terrorism Unveiled][3] has some pictures. [Wizbang][4] also has some pretty good pictures and takes note of the total lack of violence across Iraq yesterday. [WonderWoman][5] (A North American Patriot) is left speechless and is very excited about the voter turnout and what that turnout should mean to our troops who are fighting to give these people freedom.

Other bloggers touting this milestone in Iraq:

[Iraq The Model][7] (obviously)  
[California Conservative][8]  
[The Indepundit][9]  
[Protein Wisdom][10] has a great roundup.
