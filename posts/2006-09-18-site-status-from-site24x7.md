Notice the new [Site Status link][1] at the top of this page? That page shows the current response time of this site and site availability over the last 7 days. It&#8217;s really a very simple page. Nothing on it except for an iframe that grabs the site status from the [Site24x7][2] servers.

Previously, Site24x7 only had the option to &#8220;Make Public&#8221; an entire group of sites being monitored by a given user. Now they&#8217;ve added the ability to &#8220;Make Public&#8221; individual sites within a users profile. So, instead of getting the status for a list of 5 or 6 sites, I can now display the status of this site and this site alone on this page.

[I had requested][3] a &#8220;Make Public&#8221; option on an individual site basis a couple weeks ago. I think they pretty much jumped right on it, I wasn&#8217;t expecting to see this feature ready to go so quickly. Nice work guys. ðŸ™‚ I&#8217;ve also submitted a couple other suggestions to them, which they seemed to like very much. Hopefully I&#8217;ll see those implemented too.

Since we&#8217;re on the topic of site monitoring, [I came across another option][4] besides Site24x7 today. It&#8217;s called [Mon.itor.us][5]. It looks really nice, but is sort of difficult to use. It&#8217;s interface isn&#8217;t very straight forward and feels really cluttered. They do have some nice features though such as reporting and a high level of customization.

I&#8217;ll be sticking with Site24x7. It&#8217;s cleaner, quicker, and they&#8217;ve used some of my suggestions. ðŸ™‚

**UPDATE:** I should have mentioned this before. Creating a &#8220;[Site Status][1]&#8221; page like mine is only possible if your theme will allow it. Some themes are simply too narrow for an effective status page to be created.
