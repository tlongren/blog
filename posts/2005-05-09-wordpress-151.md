[WordPress 1.5.1][1] has been released. I just did an &#8220;svn update&#8221; on my local WordPress tree and noticed the version.php file got updated to &#8220;1.5.1&#8221;. Before that it was an RC version and previous to THAT it was alpha. Here&#8217;s the post at the [WordPress Development Blog][2]:

> It seemed like a good time to brighten everyoneâ€™s Monday with a new release of everyoneâ€™s favorite blogging software. Weâ€™re happy to announce the [immediate availablity of WordPress 1.5.1 for free download][3]. By our counter there were 207,981 downloads of 1.5.0 and we hope even more people will enjoy this latest release.
> 
> Whatâ€™s new? Our crack documentation team has put together a [short, technical changelog][4] but to summarize this release has a ton of bug fixes, enhancements, and an important security fix. Plugin authors especially will love all the [new API hooks and functionality][5] we added to make advanced extensions to WordPress even easier. As a user youâ€™ll find WordPress will run faster and make the world an even better place. Many thanks go out to our amazing testing and development team, who together [squashed over 170 bugs][6]!
> 
> With [our new theme system][7] in place upgrading should be a piece of cake: Just overwrite your old WordPress files and be careful not to delete anything important in your wp-content folder. There are more [detailed upgrade instructions on the Codex][8] if you need them.
