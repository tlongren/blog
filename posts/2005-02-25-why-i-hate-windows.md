Microsoft is going to disable activating windows over the internet. If you have to re-install your copy of Windows XP, you&#8217;ll now need to call Microsoft to activate it.

I pray I don&#8217;t need to re-install winxp on any pc&#8217;s here @ work.

Windows messes with your setup. Today, I changed the size of icons on my desktop. What does Windows do along with that? It rearranged all of my icons on my desktop. Why the fuck does it need to do that? Why can&#8217;t it just leave them in their current place?

[Gnome][1] would never move my icons around for me. It knows better. I&#8217;ll never install Windows on any of my personal pc&#8217;s ever again.
