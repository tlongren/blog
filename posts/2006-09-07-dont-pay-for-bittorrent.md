[TorrentFreak][1] has a post warning users not to pay for BitTorrent. Apparently, there&#8217;s lots of ads circulating that try to dupe the viewer into [purchasing a piece of software that is most likely free][2].

> Most of them are lured by misleading advertisement, and flashy banners. They end up paying $3-$30 for a completely free application. In the best case they receive a couple of links to bittorrent search engines, and a bittorrent client. Support e-mails are simply ignored.

Pretty lame, but I&#8217;d imagine it&#8217;s a pretty successful method for bringing in quick cash. On the defensive, Bittorrent Inc. has launched an advertisement campaign warning users not to pay for BitTorrent. It reads &#8220;The Official BitTorrent is entirely free. Spell it with 2 Ts and 2 Rs&#8221;.  
<!--adsense-->

  
Ernesto, the guy that runs TorrentFreak, has noticed some of these &#8220;pay for bittorrent&#8221; ads showing up on his site. He&#8217;s managed to blacklist a number of them but they just keep popping up. And his blacklist is full, so he can&#8217;t add anymore. Google should take aim at these advertisers since they&#8217;re obviously making money off a free program.

But just remember, don&#8217;t pay for BitTorrent, ever. There&#8217;s a plethora of free clients out there. Don&#8217;t pay for access to sites purporting to give access to bittorrent movies and music, they&#8217;re most likely a scam. And besides that, almost any torrent can be found on a number of BitTorrent search engines and public trackers. Bottom line is you shouldn&#8217;t have to pay a penny to use BitTorrent to it&#8217;s fullest extent. It&#8217;s all free people.

Head over to [TorrentFreak for more details][2]. Ernesto has an image of one of the Bittorrent Inc. advertisements that are currently running to warn people not to pay for BitTorrent. <!--fingerprint-->
