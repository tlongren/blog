The [new Technorati beta][1] is really awesome! It seems it was [released to public beta yesterday][2].

One thing I really like is the fact that the tags pages have numbers now, so you can see many more results for tags than you could previously. The new interface is pretty kick ass too. The part that [shows which blogs are linking to posts on other blogs][3] is very nice looking.

It&#8217;s just overall a lot better than the current Technorati. I can&#8217;t wait until it comes out of beta. There&#8217;s also a [Technorati Blog][4] to keep everyone [up to date on what&#8217;s new][5] @ Technorati.
