I noticed last month that my [Blogpulse Profile page][1] was no longer staying up to date. According to them, my last post was on August 25th. I sent an e-mail asking if something was up on their end or if there was some problem on my end.

I finally got an e-mail back yesterday. It seems some code on this site was preventing their crawler from indexing anything. I&#8217;m not gonna post the code, who knows what it&#8217;ll do if I try posting it. The code basically looked like an HTML comment and contained the text &#8220;CDATA&#8221;.

Sure enough, the offending code in the e-mail was easily found when viewing the source at this site. I was sure something was wrong on the Blogpulse side of things, I couldn&#8217;t think of any changes I had made that would affect their ability to index this site. I was wrong.

I had switched the contact form over from [WP-ContactForm][2] to [Intouch][3]. I wanted to give Intouch a shot because it made use of AJAX mostly. It worked well so I stuck with it. Turns out Intouch was the source of the bad code that prevented the blogpulse crawlers from indexing me.

After reverting back to using the WP-ContactForm plugin, everything looks good. The offending code can no longer be found here. Still waiting for my Blogpulse Profile page to update though. I&#8217;d expect it to be back in sync by the end of the weekend.

I wonder what other blog services have been unable to crawl this site due to that code.

Linked @ [California Conservative][4], [Cao&#8217;s Blog][5], [The Political Teen][6], [Outside The Beltway][7], [Mudville Gazette][8], [Jo&#8217;s Cafe][9] and [MacStansbury][10].
