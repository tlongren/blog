Since this book has been out for a little while now, it&#8217;s being offered for free in PDF format at the [Bruce Perens&#8217; Open Source Series][1] site. The entire 720 pages (9.3MB) can be downloaded from this URL:  
[http://www.phptr.com/content/&#8230;/downloads/013147149X_book.pdf][2]

It&#8217;s pretty kick ass they&#8217;re letting these books be distributed freely over the internet. Bruce Perens site I mentioned before actaully has a few free books that could be worth downloading. I was suprised at the number of books they&#8217;re offering. All you people just getting into PHP should probably check it out.
