Patrick Ruffini is conducting his [September straw poll][1]. Head over to that link to cast your votes.

He&#8217;s doing it slightly differently this time. Everything is basically the same except this poll features tagging. You can tag your vote like you&#8217;d tag a post for [technorati][2] or tag a picture for [flickr][3].

The results from last months [straw poll are available][4]. Giuliani is kickin ass and taking names.
