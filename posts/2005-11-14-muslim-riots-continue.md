What a surprise! Lastnight saw the 18th consecutive night of muslim riots in Paris. 284 cars were set ablaze and 115 people were arrested. Since October 27th, 2,652 total arrests have been made. As usual, the [Brussels Journal][1] has a good roundup:

> Hurrah! Last night was even “quieter” than the night before. According to French police statistics in the 18th consecutive night of rioting, there were violent incidents in 120 municipalities. In the whole of France 284 cars were set alight and 115 people were arrested, which brings the total number of arrests since the beginning of the riots on October 27 to 2,652. Five policemen were injured in Grenoble when a gas canister exploded in a dustbin that had been set alight. Paris was said to be “calm,” though other sources reported that a gas station had been set ablaze. The police announced that 68 cars were torched in Paris, compared to 76 the previous night. Michel Gaudin, the head of French police, said earlier that 86 vehicles burned in a single night is “about normal” in Paris. That, apparently, was more or less the pre-riot level in the capital of multicultural France.
> 
> Lyons was calm too: last night 15 cars were torched in France’s second largest city, one school was arsoned and another school was rammed with a car. Later today the French government is going to prolong the state of emergency until 21 February. The European Union will donate France 50 million euros to help recover from the damage, as if rioting is a kind of natural catastrophe, the French equivalent of Hurricane Katrina.

There&#8217;s really no major news outlets covering this anymore. I don&#8217;t think I saw anything on FoxNews about the paris riots over the weekend. CNN had a few minutes of video on their Headline News channel, but that was it. Maybe if they just ignore it the threat will just go away. [Bird&#8217;s Eye View][2] discusses a more general concept: Society before State. Good read.

[The Dread Pundit Bluto][3] has figured out the cause of the rioting, with the help of some lowly journalists . It&#8217;s caused by infants and their unwillingness to speak or learn any language at all. When will the wee ones learn?
