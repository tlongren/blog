## Make every image in a post open in a lightbox

I needed to do this about a year ago, attach `rel="lightbox"` to every image inside a WordPress post, so that the image would open in a lightbox. The lightbox plugin we were using wasn&#8217;t adding rel=&#8221;lightbox&#8221; to some images for whatever reason, so this was my quick alternative. Turned out to be incredibly simple with WordPress&#8217;s `add_filter()` function.

`add_filter()` allows developers to hook a function up to a specific **filter action**. There&#8217;s [TONS of action and filter hooks available][1], some are really, really useful. A great introduction to filter and actions hooks can be found at [WPCandy][2] or [in the WordPress Codex][3]. Smashing WordPress [has a quite detailed article, too][4].

Anyway, as usual, when adding this type of thing to WordPress, drop this code in your theme&#8217;s functions.php file to get this working:

<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">function add_lightbox_rel($content) {
       global $post;
       $pattern ="/&lt;a(.*?)href=('|")(.*?).(bmp|gif|jpeg|jpg|png)('|")(.*?)>/i";
       $replacement = '&lt;a$1href=$2$3.$4$5 rel="lightbox" title="'.$post->post_title.'"$6>';
       $content = preg_replace($pattern, $replacement, $content);
       return $content;
}
add_filter('the_content', 'add_lightbox_rel');</pre>

**You should be aware** that some plugins don&#8217;t use `rel="lightbox"` for activating their lightbox/colorbox overlay. So, if that&#8217;s the case, just modify the `theme_add_lightbox_rel()` function and change `rel="lightbox"` to `rel="whatever-plugin-uses"` in the `$replacement` variable (on line 5).

That&#8217;s it! Save your functions.php file and you should have lightboxes on all the images embedded in your post!

### Plugin Alternative

If you&#8217;d prefer to achieve this with a plugin, I&#8217;d suggest [jQuery Colorbox][5]. It does a really nice job of grouping gallery images, used for the next and previous links for navigating the gallery images.

<div class="wpulike wpulike-default " >
  <div class="wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked">
    <button type="button"
					aria-label="Like Button"
					data-ulike-id="5476"
					data-ulike-nonce="7dddc2a8cc"
					data-ulike-type="likeThis"
					data-ulike-template="wpulike-default"
					data-ulike-display-likers="0"
					data-ulike-disable-pophover="0"
					class="wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_likethis_5476"></button><span class="count-box">2+</span>
  </div>
</div>
