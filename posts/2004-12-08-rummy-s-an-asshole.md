The Albuquerque Tribune online has an interesting article about Donald Rumsfeld answering some questions from troops in Iraq. I guess he went to give a pep talk sorta thing.

During a question and answer session, Army Spc. Thomas Wilson brought up the fact that military vehicles are lacking armor:  
&#8220;Why do we soldiers have to dig through local landfills for pieces of scrap metal and compromised ballistic glass to uparmor our vehicles?&#8221;

Rummy asked him to repeat his question:  
&#8220;We do not have proper armored vehicles to carry with us north.&#8221;

Rumsfeld&#8217;s response was bullshit and probably caused more harm to soldier morale. Pep talks are usually meant to boost morale, not degrade it.

Rummy&#8217;s reply was simply &#8220;You go to war with the Army you have, not the one you want.&#8221; And &#8220;You can have all the armor in the world on a tank and it can (still) be blown up.&#8221;

I can&#8217;t believe the Secretary of Defense would say something like this. It almost sounds like he doesn&#8217;t give a shit about the troops in Iraq. A person in his position should be more sensetive to topics like this. It&#8217;s very important for the soldiers and their families.

Here&#8217;s the full story:
