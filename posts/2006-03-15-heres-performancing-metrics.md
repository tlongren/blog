[Performancing][1], the guys who brought us a great blogging tool for Firefox, have recently launched Performancing Metrics. It&#8217;s their new statistics package, designed specifically for blogs. Now, [I love Mint,][2] it lets me easily see how many people read posts and all that good stuff. Performancing Metrics basically gives the same types of data, they just have a different (and in my opinion better) method for displaying the data.

Performancing Metrics is still in beta, although they&#8217;re still accepting new signups. The service is free and will most likely remain free. In the most recent post at the Performancing blog, they mention they hope to release Performancing Metrics as an Open Source package eventually. That is absolutely, 100%, certified, killer!

About 24 hours after Performancing Metrics launched, [2500 blogs][3] were already being tracked. I think Performancing is really on to something here. They&#8217;ve got a very unique interface for displaying all the data. You can even track more than one blog from your Performancing account.

Rather than me going into details, just go to [Solution Watch][4] and read what Performancing Metrics has in store for you. They&#8217;ve got a really nice write-up along with screenshots. [ProBlogger][5] also has an extensive review of Metrics.
