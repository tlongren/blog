So, my internet has been down for the last day or so. Right now, my modem will sync up for about 2 minutes and then will go out of sync. Now it just won&#8217;t sync up and reboots itself every so often. I dunno if this is normal behavior.

Luckily I got another modem I can use. I&#8217;m on hold with Mediacom right now to see what I have to do to use that other modem. I&#8217;m pretty sure they just need the MAC address.

A tech is supposed to be out between 1:00 and 5:00 pm on April 20th. I&#8217;m hoping my modem is just fucked up.
