If you&#8217;re new around here, you might think I release a new version of HTML5Press every day. I don&#8217;t. It hasn&#8217;t seen this much development since it&#8217;s [initial release][1] over 2 years ago.

2.5.3 is another small update that removes the &#8220;custom logo url&#8221; field from the HTML5Press theme options page. It also adds support for built-in WordPress header functionality. So, if you go to Appearance in your Dashboard, then to Header, you can set a custom header image.

Now, HTML5Press wasn&#8217;t designed with a header image in mind. Because of that, I decided to stick with the default image size specified [in this article on ThemeShaper][2]. The custom-header.php file in the root html5press directory is basically an exact copy of the custom-header.php that you&#8217;ll find in the ThemeShaper article.

I updated the [theme submission ticket][3] and attached a copy of HTML5Press 2.5.3. I also asked the reviewers to please not waste their time with reviewing 2.5.1 or 2.5.2, it&#8217;s exactly that, a waste of time. Fairly certain I won&#8217;t have to change many more things around before HTML5Press is finally accepted into the WordPress Theme Directory. But, who knows.

As usual, new versions of HTML5Press, including 2.5.3, can be downloaded from the [HTML5Press page][4].
