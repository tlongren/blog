This site now sits on a server at [FlipHost][1]. I got a Storage250 server from them and added some RAM, and here we are. It&#8217;s really a pretty nice setup.

Pretty much [everything][2] I&#8217;ve [setup][3] I&#8217;ve done according to guides from Linode. Most of the guides in the Linode Library should apply at least somewhat to FlipHost.

This site was previously on Dreamhost, but there&#8217;s been a LOT of [downtime][4] [there][5] [recently][6], [a][7] [whole][8] [lot][9]. Yah, I just linked to 6 posts from dreamhoststatus.com that were posted from May 12 through May 17. Crazy.

FlipHost [wooed me on twitter][10] and so far I&#8217;m really, really glad that they did.

I&#8217;ve already canceled the one VPS that I had at Dreamhost. May keep the shared account around for some other sites, but may end up moving absolutely everything to FlipHost. I haven&#8217;t really decided yet.
