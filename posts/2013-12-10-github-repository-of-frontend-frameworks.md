I&#8217;m partial to [Bootstrap][1], but have recently strayed away from it because I found myself relying too heavily on the default styles. Next I tried [Zurb Foundation][2] which I really liked. I used it to build the [VPSstat.us blog][3] and [main site][4].

There&#8217;s a crap ton of front-end frameworks. Some are barebones, like [Skeleton][5], and others are full featured, like [Bootstrap][1] and [Foundation][2].

To help make sense of it all, [usabli.ca][6] put together [a GitHub repository][7] dedicated to indexing all (or most) of the frontend frameworks. It&#8217;s definitely worth checking out, especially if you&#8217;re in the market for a new framework or just want to see what options are out there.

Lately I&#8217;ve been using [Purecss][8]. I think it&#8217;s a nice middle ground, providing just enough to get me going quickly on most projects. Purecss can also make use of some Bootstrap elements and scripts, [like modals][9]. I&#8217;ve been using Purecss with [kegplan.io][10]. It forces me to come up with design elements not part of the framework itself, but only where needed.

<div id="polls-10" class="wp-polls">

<div id="polls-10-loading" class="wp-polls-loading">
  <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.longren.io/wp-content/plugins/wp-polls/images/loading.gif?resize=16%2C16&#038;ssl=1" width="16" height="16" alt="Loading ..." title="Loading ..." class="wp-polls-image" data-recalc-dims="1" />&nbsp;Loading ...
</div>

**Update Dec 12, 2013:** A few comments were left noting some frameworks that are missing. I [added Layers CSS][11] and also [fixed the link to Twitter Bootstrap][12]. I&#8217;ve also created a branch to add the [Inuit.css framework][13], but there&#8217;s currently [a pull request pending to add Inuit CSS][14], however it seems to have stalled. So we&#8217;ll see if I can send a pull request in the next day or so for Inuit CSS.

I&#8217;ve also submitted pull requests for [StackLayout][15], [bootmetro][16], and hopefully Inuit CSS. I have a personal interest in this repository, so I&#8217;ll likely keep contributing to it.

Thanks to [Razvan for the Inuit suggestion][17], and [Naeem for the Layers suggestion][18]!

If there&#8217;s any other frameworks missing, which I&#8217;m sure there are, please mention them here and I&#8217;ll get them added to the repository. Or, you can even add to the repository yourself by sending a pull request. Here&#8217;s how I typically create a branch for a pull request.

  1. Clone the repo (_git clone git@github.com:usablica/front-end-frameworks.git_)
  2. Create your feature branch (_git checkout -b add-specific-framework_)
  3. Make your additions to README.md
  4. Commit your additions to your new branch (_git commit -am &#8216;Add some framework&#8217;_)
  5. Push to the branch (_git push origin add-specific-framework_)
  6. Create new Pull Request by going to the original repo. There should be a green &#8220;Compare and pull request&#8221; button that&#8217;s not typically there, _**click it**_! Enter your comments and wait for the repo owner to merge your branch or suggest some changes.
