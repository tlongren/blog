For some time now, comments have been disabled on pages in [K2][1] and [Unwakeable][2]. The modifications needed to allow comments on pages are extremely easy to make. If you use either of these themes and wish to enable comments on pages, please continue reading.  
[ad]  
**1.** Open the **page.php** file located in your K2 or Unwakeable theme directory. Go to line 36, it should look like this:

<pre><?php if ( get_post_custom_values('comments') ): ?></pre>

**2.** Comment out that if statement, so it should look like this when you&#8217;re done:

<pre><?php //if ( get_post_custom_values('comments') ): ?></pre>

**3.** You&#8217;re halfway done at this point. Now go to line 40, which should look like this:

<pre><?php endif; ?></pre>

**4.** Comment out this piece of code as well, so modify line 40 so it looks like the code below.

<pre><?php //endif; ?></pre>

**5.** Save the **page.php** file and you should be all set.

I will make this modification in the next release of Unwakeable so you won&#8217;t have to modify it yourself. You can expect to see a new version of Unwakeable released within a week.
