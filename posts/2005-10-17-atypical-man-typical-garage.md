Karl Rove [has a typical garage][1]. Pretty mind blowing huh? [Euphoric Reality][2] has a picture, I dunno wether or not it&#8217;s real. None of the yahoo or google news items seem to have any photos associated with them. Or maybe I&#8217;m just blind.

The AP should kick their own ass, all the bandwidth wasted on distributing such garbage. I figure I might as well donate some bandwidth towards the cause. [Don Surber][3] has some pretty [entertaining commentary][4]. Instead of me wasting more time writing, I&#8217;ll just let you visit Don.

Linked at [Outside The Beltway][5] and [The Political Teen][6].
