[Yesterday we saw the debut][1] of Ice Cream Sandwich (Android 4.0) on the Samsung Galaxy Nexus. Google also released the SDK for Ice Cream Sandwich, which contains some neat graphical goodies developers can start using to create Ice Cream Sandwich themes for ADW, Cyanogenmod, or whatever else really.

DameonAndMeagan at the XDA Developers forum has [created a modification][2] for Cyanogenmod 7.1 that will make the **ring screen lock** resemble the one found in Ice Cream Sandwich. There&#8217;s a few colors you can choose from, they&#8217;re all [attached to this thread for download][2].  
[ad]  
To go along with that, [sonnysekhon][3], also at the XDA Developers forum, has [created an initial Ice Cream Sandwich theme][4] for the **Cyanogenmod theme chooser**. The theme has lots of bugs as you might expect, and a lot of missing graphics, but it does work. sonnysekhon has only had a day or so to put this together, so I expect he will be making improvements rather quickly. **UPDATE:** This Ice Cream Sandwich theme is [now available on the Android Market][5].

[sonnysekhon][3] has also included an &#8220;extras&#8221; zip file that contains **wallpapers from Ice Cream Sandwich**, as well as icons. Both downloads (the extras and the CM7 theme) can be found [attached to his thread][4].

A new font, **Roboto**, is the default in Ice Cream Sandwich. [Android Police has details][6] on how to set it as your font on your current (rooted) Android phone. They recommended using the [Font Changer][7] application, however I used [Font Installer][8] and was able to get it installed without any problems.

[Kovdev][9] has an [**Ice Cream Sandwich theme for ADW Launcher**, Launcher Pro and Go Launcher EX][10] available that&#8217;s pretty nice. I&#8217;m not using it in the screenshots attached to this post, but you can find some [in the Android Market][10].

In the screenshots below I&#8217;m using the Ice Cream Sandwich CM7 theme and the Ice Cream Sandwich ring lock mod. The ADW theme is [ADW Faenza][11] and the wallpaper is from Ice Cream Sandwich.

I&#8217;ll keep this post updated as more Ice Cream Sandwich theme items are released.

**UPDATE 10/23/2011:** [sonnysekhon][3] released alpha 3 of his Ice Cream Sandwich Theme Chooser theme for Cyanogenmod. I sent him a message a few days ago asking what his future plans were for the theme. He says that he plans to have the Ice Cream Sandwich theme released to the Android Market within a week. So it&#8217;ll be much easier to install and update that theme once he gets it on the Market.

**UPDATE 10/24/2011:** [AChep][12] has released [an Ice Cream Sandwich Cyanogenmod theme][13]. He&#8217;s even got a version with a transparent status bar, which is a feature I&#8217;ve come to like a lot lately. I couldn&#8217;t get it to work on my Defy though, probably because it&#8217;s for MDPI devices only.

Also new is an [**Ice Cream Sandwich themed keyboard**][14] by [proxuser][15]. Not something I&#8217;ll probably use as I&#8217;m pretty loyal to SwiftKey X. Can&#8217;t see myself ever using another keyboard for Android.

**UPDATE 10/27/2011:** [DameonAndMeagan][16] has another [mod to **make your Gingerbread device sound like Ice Cream Sandwich**][17]. It has Ice Cream Sandwich sounds for lock, unlock, camera shutter, and others. It comes in a flashable zip to install via custom recovery. You can find it [at this thread on the XDA Developers Forum][17].
