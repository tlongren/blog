## Clean and well-documented source {.subtitle}

[Belt][1] is a really handy, and relatively new tool set for PHP developers. It&#8217;s [initial commit was only 9 days before][2] the date this post was published.

However, it still looks very usable and rather mature. Code has been added at a pretty quick pace, there&#8217;s been 102 commits since Belt&#8217;s release on GitHub, a little over a week ago.

It&#8217;s release under the [MIT license][3], so it&#8217;s compatible with the GPL and can safely used in [WordPress][4] themes and functions, if you want them included in the official repositories. 

Basically, you just include `belt` and use it&#8217;s built in methods/functions to do certain things that would take a bit more work using straight PHP. For example, to get the maximun of an array of numbers, do this:

<pre class="lang:php decode:true " ><?php Belt::max([1, 2, 3]) ?></pre>

A value of `3` will be returned, because it&#8217;s the max value there.

And from the readme, a [list of what Belt offers][5].

  * 60+ useful functions
  * ability to use the facade Belt or a dedicated component (e.g. BeltUtilities)
  * fully tested
  * source code is clean and documented

Seems like it offers some pretty useful functions, and it looks really easy to use. I&#8217;ve been looking for a solid PHP base to use and this may just be it. Anyone got any other suggestions? I&#8217;ve heard a lot about Skeleton for PHP. 

Searching for &#8220;skeleton&#8221; on GitHub, then filtering for PHP, gives [a LOT of result][6]s, over 1,000 results to be more precise. So, maybe I&#8217;ll browse there for a while before making a decision.

Any suggestions can be [left in the comments][7].
