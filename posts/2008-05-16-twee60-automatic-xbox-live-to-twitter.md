[Twee60][1] is a web based application that tweets your status on Xbox Live to your Twitter account. The nice thing about Twee60 is there&#8217;s no software to install, unlike the Xbox Live to Twitter application [I wrote about previously][2].  
[ad]  
Don&#8217;t get me wrong, Martin&#8217;s [Xbox Live to Twitter][3] app does a very nice job and offers many more customization options than Twee60. Twee60 is ideal for me though because it doesn&#8217;t require any software to be installed.

Twee60 is especially nice for Linux or Mac users who don&#8217;t even have a software package they _could_ install to tweet their Xbox Live status. I installed a Windows box at home just so I could run Martin&#8217;s Xbox Live to Twitter app. Now that I have Twee60, I can take that box down.  
[ad]  
There&#8217;s only a few options you need to set in Twee60 before it&#8217;s ready to tweet your Xbox Live status. All you&#8217;ll need is your gamertag, twitter e-mail, twitter password, and zip code. Xbox Live members who are also Twitter users should [check it out][1] and [register an account][4].
