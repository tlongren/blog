[Well lookie here][1]! Epsylon3 has released the first Cyanogenmod 9 nightly build for the Motorola Defy. There&#8217;s still a pretty hefty list of things that are broken, but it&#8217;s way smaller [than it was last week][2].

Download links for the Cyanognemod 9 (CM9) nightlies can be found at <http://tanguy.forumdoandroid.com/>. That site contains links to various downloads. If you want to run Cyanogenmod 9, you&#8217;ll want this link <http://defy-cm.net/ics-test0/>.  
[ad]  
As expected, some things are still broken:

  * Fix orientation sensor
  * Fix Google maps
  * Fix 3D
  * Fix camera (will be hard)

Don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m quite ready to try this out yet. I&#8217;ll give it a shot on my Defy once the orientation sensor is working properly. Might wait for the camera to be 100% functional too, I use my phone camera often for taking pictures and video of my daughter.

Here are some screenshots:
