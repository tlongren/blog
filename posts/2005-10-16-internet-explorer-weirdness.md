Some of you usuing Internet Explorer might come across some problems browsing this site, or you might not. Actually, I shouldn&#8217;t say problems, &#8220;minor defects&#8221; is more appropriate. Sometimes, when loading this site under IE, the navigation menu, everything from the &#8220;Search&#8221; on down, is pushed all the way to the bottom of the page. So, if you&#8217;re at the very top of the page, you probably won&#8217;t even see the menu until you scroll about halfway down.

I thought I had the issue tracked down at one point, but that&#8217;s obviously not true. Previously, I had a list showing the geographical locations of the last 5 visitors. The nav menu would go all the way to the bottom of the page each time I loaded longren.org in IE. I removed the recent visitors list from the page, cleared IE&#8217;s cache and refreshed. The nav menu looked normal, right up top where it should be.

Now, I can&#8217;t even get the menu to load at the bottom every time. Sometimes it will, sometimes it won&#8217;t. For example, I&#8217;m at the office right now and the menu looks fine on my PC in IE. If I move to another PC and load longren.org in IE, the menu will be at the bottom. All the PC&#8217;s here have IE 6.0 w/ SP2.

I can&#8217;t for the life of me figure this out, and it makes me very sad to say that. I&#8217;m gonna check it out while I&#8217;m here @ work so I can at least have a PC that the problem occurs on almost every time the page is loaded. If anyone&#8217;s got any suggestions, please let me know.

Linked @ [Cao&#8217;s Blog][1], [Wizbang][2], [The Florida Masochist][3], [Outside The Beltway][4], and as usual, [Basils Blog][5].

**UPDATE:** Well, maybe this isn&#8217;t linked at some of the sites mentioned. I have noticed that TrackBacks on some sites aren&#8217;t working properly, [Basil has all the dirt][6] on what&#8217;s up with that. Hopefully TypePad and HaloScan get that fixed up soon, it&#8217;s sorta annoying.
