[Slackware 10.2][1] has been released. I will probably upgrade to 10.2 sometime this weekend. I know the Dropline guys are hard at work prepping their Gnome 2.12 release for Slackware 10.2. They were expecting Slackware 10.2 to be released right about now. Below is taken straight from the Slackware homepage:

> Slackware 10.2 includes the Linux 2.4.31 kernel, with Linux 2.6.13 available in the /testing directory. For the first time, a 2.6 kernel with support for SCSI, RAID, and SATA is offered as a boot option in the installer (called &#8220;test26.s&#8221;). Slackware 10.2 also sports a new revision of glibc (2.3.5) with NPTL support for improved thread performance when using a kernel with NPTL support, the latest KDE 3.4.2 and XFce 4.2.2 desktop environments, updated development tools, and new additions like SASL support in sendmail, the Subversion version control system, the Firefox browser, and the Thunderbird email and news client. For a complete list of changes since Slackware 10.1, check out the Slackware 10.2 [ChangeLog][2].
> 
> Read the official [announcement here][3].
> 
> To order the official release of Slackware or other Slackware products (and help support the Slackware project), visit the [Slackware store][4].
> 
> ISO images are available through BitTorrent [here][5].
> 
> A list of mirrors that are likely to be among the first offering the 10.2 release may be found [here][6]. 

I&#8217;m excited. I love new Slackware releases, nothing more exciting. [Azmeen at HTNet][7] has word of the new Slackware too. I bet he&#8217;s just as excited as I am.
