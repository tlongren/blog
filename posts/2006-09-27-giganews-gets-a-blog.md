A week ago, [Giganews increased their retention][1] of binary usenet posts from 70 days to 90 days. Now, they&#8217;ve setup an [official Giganews blog][2]. Their [first post][3] says they&#8217;ll use the blog to keep &#8220;customers up to date on everything going on at Giganews&#8221;. If the site content were left simply at that, there wouldn&#8217;t be much content at all. I don&#8217;t think Giganews has many problems that they need to inform customers about. Their service has always worked 100% for me.

Luckily, they&#8217;ll also be posting on usenet related technologies, so I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;ll be any lack of content. There&#8217;s a lot of interesting things going on in the usenet world at the moment. But I won&#8217;t go into that here.

Hooray for you Giganews!
