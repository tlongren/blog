First of all, [Stop The ACLU][2] got a full page, color ad in the Washington Times. If you haven&#8217;t seen it yet, you can do so [HERE.][3]

Every year we have come to expect the ACLU to wage war on Christmas. Just recently, the ADF won a victory for a [school threatened by the ACLU over a nativity scene.][4] The ACLU have created an environment that has spread like a virus across the nation. The far left have taken the politically correct ball and ran with it. They have redefined in their own minds, and in the minds of many Americans that &#8220;all inclusive&#8221; means &#8220;excluding&#8221; Christianity.

The environment the ACLU have created through threatening tactics across the years have made many schools proactive. In order to avoid lawsuits, some schools straight out [banned the C word.][5] This year, however, [legal groups are being preemptive.][6] The Alliance Defense Fund has even [devoted a website][7], and offered free legal advice to any who feel they are being censored this year. 

A backlash is happening this year as the American people are making their voices known. Wal-Mart felt the backlash, and backed off the politically correct exclusion of the word Christmas after [being threatened with a boycott.][8] Boston [set off a furor][9] this week when it officially renamed a giant tree erected in a city park a &#8220;holiday tree&#8221; instead of a &#8220;Christmas tree.&#8221;

The Capitol officially returned to calling it a [Christmas tree instead of a holiday tree.][10] Lowes also dumped the &#8220;holiday&#8221; reference after public outcry. 

One Michagan family was told they could not display a nativity scene on their own lawn. After being threatened with fines if they did not remove it, they contacted the Thomas More Law Center, and [were victorious in standing up for their rights.][11]

Bill O&#8217;Reilly is leading the charge on his show, featuring [the secularization of Christmas.][12] John Gibson, also of FOX news has even [written a book about it.][13] 

They are not alone, bloggers are reacting too. [California Conservative][14] has teamed up with us, and created a [petition to support Christmas.][15] Stop The ACLU is providing [Christmas decorations for your blog.][16] Kevin McCullough is asking his readers to [send the ACLU Christmas cards.][17]

Across the nation, people are standing up to the ACLU. In Georgia, legislators are [proposing a bill][18] that would allow counties to freely display historical documents &#8220;without threat from the ACLU. The Louisiana Legislature has [approved a resolution][19] urging Congress to pass the Constitution Restoration Act, a bill that would prohibit federal courts from ruling in cases involving government officials who acknowledge God &#8220;as the sovereign source of law, liberty or government.&#8221; Under the bill, any judge who violates the proposed rule by making &#8220;extrajurisdictional&#8221; decisions will have committed an offense that is grounds for impeachment. 

Representative Hostettler has introduced [legislation to the House][20] that would limit attorney fees in Establishment Clause cases to injunctive relief only.

We have a petition set up asking Congress to [stop taxpayer funding for the ACLU.][21] Stand up, and fight the ACLU.
