## Load (cpu and memory) was significantly lower than I expected {.subtitle}

Didn&#8217;t expect anything specific for load, but more load than what I did see, for sure.

A [post I made][1] hit the [front page of HackerNews][2] the other day. Here&#8217;s the [discussion at HackerNews][3]. Traffic was steady, For about five hours, there were between 50 and 250 users on the site at any given time.

I use two [DigitalOcean][4] droplets, one running Apache 2, the other for MySQL (mostly). The Apache 2 droplet is a 2GB droplet in the NYC2 datacenter and the MySQL droplet is a 1GB droplet in the same datacenter. They talk to each other over a private network.

I&#8217;ve really liked the setup so far, and without any tweaks to Apache or MySQL, both servers have performed quite well. I use a WordPress caching plugin and [CloudFlare][5], but that&#8217;s all there is for caching.

<figure id="attachment_6530" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6530" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">[<img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/longren.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/cpu.png?resize=672%2C219" alt="CPU Usage" width="672" height="219" class="size-full wp-image-6530" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.longren.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/cpu.png?w=672&ssl=1 672w, https://i1.wp.com/www.longren.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/cpu.png?resize=150%2C48&ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/www.longren.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/cpu.png?resize=300%2C97&ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" data-recalc-dims="1" />][6]<figcaption id="caption-attachment-6530" class="wp-caption-text">CPU usage remained quite low, you can clearly see the HackerNews traffic.</figcaption></figure>

Eventually, one could expect thousands of users on a site at any given time. That greatly depends on the type of site, though.

At that point, you&#8217;d probably need [the power of Nginx, using it as a front-end (reverse) proxy to Apache][7].

I&#8217;m going to setup a [DigitalOcean droplet][4] to serve as a reverse proxy in the event I need to serve massive amounts of traffic. It&#8217;s sole job will be to run [Nginx][8].

I simply don&#8217;t need it right now, though. Unless this hits the front page of HackerNews and makes it further up the page. `;)`. Then I&#8217;ll be scrambling to get that Nginx box up. So, put me to work later.

<figure id="attachment_6538" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6538" style="width: 639px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">[<img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/longren.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/bandwidth.png?resize=639%2C216" alt="Bandwidth Usage" width="639" height="216" class="size-full wp-image-6538" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.longren.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/bandwidth.png?w=639&ssl=1 639w, https://i0.wp.com/www.longren.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/bandwidth.png?resize=150%2C50&ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/www.longren.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/bandwidth.png?resize=300%2C101&ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 639px) 100vw, 639px" data-recalc-dims="1" />][9]<figcaption id="caption-attachment-6538" class="wp-caption-text">Highest bandwidth usage was 2.33Mbps. DigitalOcean can do a LOT more than that.</figcaption></figure>

I didn&#8217;t receive any alerts from [New Relic][10], [Mist.io][11], or [Uptime Robot][12], so all was good. I am, however, still going to prep some kind of solution with Nginx sitting in front of Apache, to at least serve static files.
