## So many themes and color schemes {.subtitle}

These aren&#8217;t exactly new, but I&#8217;ve been around the Sublime Text theme scene for a while and I&#8217;d never seen these two. So, here you go!

## amCoder

[amCoder][1] describes itself as a &#8220;_Hyperminimal UI Theme for Sublime Text 2/3 with Love of Monokai_.&#8221; It&#8217;s based on [Spacegray][2], and is optimized for Monokai.

[amCoder can be installed via Package Control][3] and can also be [found on GitHub][1]. Here&#8217;s a screenshot of the **amCoder** Sublime Text theme:

## Minimal Sublime Text

[Minimal Sublime Text][5] is a flat version of the default Sublime Text theme. That&#8217;s probably why I like it so much.

It also comes with a dark sidebar version and [can be installed via Package Control][6]. Imagine that. `:)` Minimal Sublime Text is [available on Github as well][5]. A screenshot of Minimal Sublime Text is below:  
[<img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/longren.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/minimal.jpg?resize=850%2C540" alt="minimal" width="850" height="540" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6930" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.longren.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/minimal.jpg?w=850&ssl=1 850w, https://i1.wp.com/www.longren.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/minimal.jpg?resize=150%2C95&ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/www.longren.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/minimal.jpg?resize=300%2C190&ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" data-recalc-dims="1" />][7]
