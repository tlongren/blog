The latest version of Firefox (named Deer Park) is out. It&#8217;s basically the Firefox 1.1 branch. I haven&#8217;t played with it much yet, but the first thing I noticed was the Options window. It looks more like it does in Galeon or Epiphany in Gnome. I think I like the old style better, but whatever.

It&#8217;s still in the alpha stage. It was just released to public alpha lasnight or this morning, not quite sure. You can [go get it][1] if you dare. I haven&#8217;t had any issues with it. A fair amount of my plugins/extensions even work in it. The ones that matter work, like ForecastFox, Adblock, and Sage.

Blogs for Firefox has a [pretty good summary][2].
