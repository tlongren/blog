**UPDATE:** It&#8217;s [not in London][1]!

A series of large explosions rocked a London Oil Depot earlier today. A &#8220;massive blaze&#8221; [is still raging][2] at the site of the explosion.  
[  
Memoria Technica][3] has an amazing picture, go check it out. The BBC is reporting that there are no known deaths. There are 43 injured so far though.

[The American Mind][4] has more pictures and some updates. [The Moderate Voice][5] has one update and has a picture of the smoke clouds, visible from satellite.
