I haven&#8217;t seen it rain in a long time it feels like. It was supposed to rain yesterday, but that didn&#8217;t happen till about midnight lastnight. It was all done by the time I got up this morning for work.

Between 9:00 and 10:30 today it was sunny as a mother fucker out. Started getting really warm too. I went to the warehouse in Ankeny around noon, and by the time I got back around 2:30 pm, it was starting to sprinkle a little bit.

It finally started down pouring around 5:00, shortly before I left work. From the looks of the radar images, it&#8217;ll be raining for a while, probably through tomorrow afternoon. I hope so. I dunno why, I&#8217;ve just been wanting it to rain a lot. I think I miss all the fun thunderstorms in Iowa during the spring and summer months. Can&#8217;t wait for the tornadoes&#8230;
