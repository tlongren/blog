So I finally installed Unreal Tournament 2004 on my Linux box yesterday. I installed on the one that I just put those 933mhz processors in. The game performs very, very well. All the details are set to the highest values. It runs very smooth and looks great. It&#8217;s hella addicting too, I couldn&#8217;t stop playing lastnight. Too bad I can&#8217;t play online.

I downloaded a bunch of patches for it today while at work. I&#8217;ll prolly apply them this evening when I get home.
