This is wicked cool and going to be really useful for us here at work. We&#8217;re having to track packages all the time with FedEx and UPS. Google is gonna make it easy on us.

All you do is enter a tracking number, and Google will provide a link to the tracking page for your package. It&#8217;s really neat and can search UPC codes, FCC equipment ID&#8217;s, Vehicle ID numbers.

You should check it out: <http://www.google.com/help/features.html#number>
