I got my computer fixed. I&#8217;m pretty sure one of the 10,000rpm SCSI drives died when the power went out here. I installed Slackware on another hard drive and everything is running smoothly again.

I&#8217;m also going up to UNI this weekend. I&#8217;ll probably be there until Sunday afternoon.

I also made a folder on the web server to store screenshots in:  
<A href=http://longren.no-ip.org/screenshots/>http://longren.no-ip.org/screenshots/</a>. So, you can have a look at those if you want to. I guess that&#8217;s it until I get back from UNI.
