**Update Feb 20, 2014:** This is a really old post. You&#8217;d be more interested in [this post about the Flappy Bird game][1], and how terrible I am.  
Certainly since I&#8217;ve been in the [TTLB Ecosystem][2], [Instapundit][3] has been #1. Even before I put my blog on there, Instapundit was #1.

[Michelle Malkin][4] has taken the #1 spot, overtaking Instapundit in number of incoming links. Amazing!

Both are undoubtedly &#8220;Higher Beings&#8221;. Unfortunately for yours truly, I&#8217;m not even a mammal of any sort! But at least I&#8217;ve got a spine, the spine of a Flappy Bird. I need to root out some local people to blog with me. I&#8217;d like to spend a lot more time writing here, but I just don&#8217;t have the time available. Maybe when work slows down this winter I&#8217;ll be able to write more. Really though, I&#8217;m just happy Michelle and Instapundit are still ahead of Kos. I hope Kos doesn&#8217;t reach #1 anytime soon.

Anyway, congrats Michelle!
