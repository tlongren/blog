[The Washington Times][1] is reporting on democrats being OK with employing race-baiting tactics agains black republicans. What do black democrats say about it? They&#8217;re all cool with it, saying it&#8217;s just &#8220;pointing out the obvious.&#8221; Maryland Lt. Gov. Michael S. Steele, who is a republican, is the target of all this racism from various colored members of the democratic party.

> Black Democratic leaders in Maryland say that racially tinged attacks against Lt. Gov. Michael S. Steele in his bid for the U.S. Senate are fair because he is a conservative Republican.  
> Such attacks against the first black man to win a statewide election in Maryland include pelting him with Oreo cookies during a campaign appearance, calling him an &#8220;Uncle Tom&#8221; and depicting him as a black-faced minstrel on a liberal Web log.  
> Operatives for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) also obtained a copy of his credit report &#8212; the only Republican candidate so targeted.  
> But black Democrats say there is nothing wrong with &#8220;pointing out the obvious.&#8221;  
> &#8220;There is a difference between pointing out the obvious and calling someone names,&#8221; said a campaign spokesman for Kweisi Mfume, a Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate and former president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.

That&#8217;s freakin amazing. I don&#8217;t really know what to think or to say, other than wow. People are worried about the state of the repulican party. The democrats have a lot more to worry about than republicans do. They&#8217;ve alienated a large portion of their constituency, too bad it&#8217;ll probably go un-noticed.

Why aren&#8217;t people like Jesse Jackson freaking out right now? Democrats are the ones constantly preaching tolerance and acceptance of all. How the hell can they preach tolerance when they won&#8217;t even practice racial tolerance on their end? It&#8217;s just not right. They&#8217;re fighting for the rights of individuals that have the desire to kill every American, yet they&#8217;re fine with being racist towards black members of the republican party. This just goes to show that the left in this country hates America.

This really pisses me off. They&#8217;re willing to be racist against American citizens simply because they&#8217;re black republicans. Yet they refuse to exhibit any sort of racism towards those that are deserving of racism. War should be declared on the democratic party, they should all be ousted from U.S. borders.
