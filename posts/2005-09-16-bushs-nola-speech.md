President Bush was on the tele lastnight discussing basically everything Katrina. I didn&#8217;t listen to much of it, maybe 15 minutes total. From what I heard, Bush did an excellent job. I heard him promising lots of money to lots of people. Hopefully he follows through.

If I was a refugee from Katrina, hearing Bush&#8217;s words lastnight would have put my mind at ease, at least for a while. He did a great job of explaining himself and touching on all the major pieces the MSM has brought up in regards to Katrina. I don&#8217;t think he could have done a much better job.

There is going to be a lot of money spent, no doubt about it. [Sister Toldjah][1] thinks it&#8217;ll end up being more than $200 billion, I agree. Other fiscal conservatives are blowing their gaskets at the amount of money Bush plans on spending on the rebuilding efforts. We&#8217;re rebuilding basically the entire gulf coast. An undertaking like that won&#8217;t come cheap. Is it worth it? I&#8217;d say yes.

[Pundit Guy][2] was left with a fowl taste in his mouth:

> Presidents who give away other peoples money have always given me a bad taste in my mouth. And tonight, while watching George W. Bush, that taste showed up.

and

> Once he started handing out the candy&#8230;it seemed as though he just couldn&#8217;t stop. The costs for rebuilding could reach $200 billion or beyond. And this is $200 billion ABOVE AND BEYOND the cost of the war.

All valid points. I would rather see all this money being poured into the war on terror. Since Katrina was here that won&#8217;t happen though. Bush knows he has to spend more money here, in his own country rather than spending money internationally. If he didn&#8217;t give huge amounts of money to rebuild and support Katrina victims, he would be run out of the country by the kook liberal nutjobs. He&#8217;s really doing the only thing he can do.
