HTML5Press is now known as [RootDip][1]. I didn&#8217;t put [much effort into picking a new name][2], simply because I don&#8217;t have much time to put into this thing right now ([work][3], [vpsstat.us][4], [book][5], [wedding][6], 3 year old daughter, and more).

I&#8217;ve renamed the [GitHub repo][7], changed every occurrence of HTML5Press to RootDip in the theme itself, and released version 2.5.4 as the first version baring the RootDip name.

In addition to the name change, I threw in a new font, [Lato][8], from [Google Web Fonts][9]. It&#8217;s the font I&#8217;m currently using here at longren.org. Also, RootDip 2.5.4 is running here right now. It&#8217;s a totally stock copy, straight from the GitHub repository.

Would have gotten around to this earlier but have been pretty caught up with [VPSstat.us][4] and adding [support for Dreamhost and Linode][10].

I&#8217;ll be submitting RootDip to the WordPress theme directory again, so we&#8217;ll see how that goes now that it&#8217;s got a valid name.
