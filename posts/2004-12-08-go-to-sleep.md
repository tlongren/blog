That&#8217;s what my notebook did lastnight. It went to sleep. The display is working on it again, but I think the hard drive went out on it. It just restarted itself yesterday while I was @ home. I was waiting for it to come back up, but it never did. It gave the good ole &#8220;Operating System not found&#8221; message. I am gonna try installing Slackware on it tonight when I get home from work. I&#8217;ll might even get another hard drive for it and use it as a router since the display doesn&#8217;t work to well (hasn&#8217;t worked at all the last 3 months up until now).

But anyway, that&#8217;s about all that&#8217;s going on. We had the company Christmas party last Friday. It was alright. Company Christmas parties aren&#8217;t exactly my thing though. I got a few gifts and a Christmas bonus.

Today I&#8217;m meeting with the owners to discuss our database problems and why we need to move away from Access ASAP. The Access database has about 1 million rows total. And has 5 users accessing the data at any one time. It&#8217;s not good. 

<div class="wpulike wpulike-default " >
  <div class="wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked">
    <button type="button"
					aria-label="Like Button"
					data-ulike-id="1724"
					data-ulike-nonce="fc4d60ba99"
					data-ulike-type="likeThis"
					data-ulike-template="wpulike-default"
					data-ulike-display-likers="0"
					data-ulike-disable-pophover="0"
					class="wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_likethis_1724"></button><span class="count-box"></span>
