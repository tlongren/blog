I&#8217;ve always enjoyed the [svbtle][1] design. Shortly after it became a _thing_, the [wp-svbtle theme was made][2]. It does a really nice job of replicating the look and feel of the svbtle.com site. In the [wp-svbtle readme][3], it even states that it&#8217;s an extremely unoriginal idea, but that&#8217;s kinda the point.

As you can tell, I&#8217;m using wp-svbtle here on longren.org now. I made a small change to the theme to allow featured images (post thumbnails) on posts. Pretty much all my posts from the last year+ have a featured image set, and I still wanted those to display, even while using wp-svbtle. You can see the featured image for this post in the top left, it&#8217;s a circle and clicking on it will take you to the post permalink.

After I made the modifications to allow featured images, I [sent a pull request][4] to the official wp-svbtle repo on GitHub. Could be a while before it&#8217;s merged (if it&#8217;s even merged at all), the wp-svbtle repo hasn&#8217;t been updated in over 4 months. So, we&#8217;ll see.

If development on it has truly stalled for good, I&#8217;ll probably update my master branch to include the featured images support. Right now, you can find it in the [&#8220;post-thumbnails&#8221; branch][5] at my [GitHub fork][6].
