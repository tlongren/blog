I hope everyone that&#8217;s reading has a wonderful and safe 4th of July. This is our beautiful countries 229th birthday. Mine 4th has gone exactly how I wanted so far. Although I have had to go into work a few more times than I&#8217;d have liked.

Ashley&#8217;s dad went down to Missouri last weekend on his motorcycle. He brought us back some fireworks. He brought us some of the big shells and a few other things. Kyle, my brother, went down to Missouri yesterday with his girlfriend and another of his friends. They also brought Ashley and I back some goodies.

We&#8217;ve been house watching for Ashleys aunt and uncle. We&#8217;ll probably go out to their house later tonight to light off some fireworks.

Nevada&#8217;s little 4th of July parade was interesting. The fire trucks actually woke me up so I went outside to see what was going on. Needless to say it was pretty lame. There were lots of little ponies and little tractor things.

I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re gonna do a whole lot today. It&#8217;s still pretty cloudy out and it&#8217;s actually pretty cool out for July in Iowa. I&#8217;m pretty sure I could drink from the air though, it&#8217;s really humid.

Yesterday Ash and I went to Hickory Grove again and got a paddle boat. I got burned some but not too bad. It started getting really cloudy when we started heading back in. It was really windy the whole time we were out there.

But yah, I&#8217;ve got some things to do before I can write anymore.
