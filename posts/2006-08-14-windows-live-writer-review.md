Microsoft released a fresh and shiny WYSIWYG blogging tool today. It&#8217;s called [Windows Live Writer][1]. Microsoft needs to hire some new people to choose names for these new products. The name alone makes me not want to use it.

Now, the stupid name aside, the tool actually looks like it could be very useful. [Paul Stamatiou has a very lengthy review][2], from installation to actually publishing a blog post.

Windows Live Writer is still in beta, so expect some issues if you&#8217;re going to be using it. Apparently it&#8217;ll play nicely with pretty much any blogging platform. Rather than me writing more, [just go read Paul&#8217;s review][2].

Want more reviews? Head over to to [Elliot Back&#8217;s blog][3] or [Pro Blogger][4].
