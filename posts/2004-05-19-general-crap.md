My brother graduated from high school last sunday. It&#8217;s a good thing he didn&#8217;t get any suspensions towards the end of school, or his graduting might not have happened.

I&#8217;ve also been interviewing at <a href=http://www.orthoii.com/>Ortho II in Ames. I&#8217;d be building and fixing computers for their orthodontic clients. Support phone calls would also be part of my duty. It looks like a fun place to work, quite laid back. I really hope I get that job.

DJ Pi is also about to release Trance Empire Vol 8. He uploaded it to me the other day and I think he&#8217;s planning to release it sometime tomorrow. As usual, it will be available on the **<a href=http://longren.no-ip.org/tracker/>tracker**. Also on the tracker are a couple new Doboy mixes, including Trancequility 30 and Vocal Edition 11.

Also, the DJ Pi website is getting closer to being finished. It looks really good so far!!
