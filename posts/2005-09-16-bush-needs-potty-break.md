I saw [this][1] via [WizBang][2] just a few minutes ago. It&#8217;s scary that Reuters has the balls to photoshop a note to make it look like Bush wanted to take a bathroom break during a meeting.

Reuters has [already explained][3], saying &#8220;There was no malicious intent. That&#8217;s not what we do.&#8221; That&#8217;s a bullshit explanation though for photoshopping a note Bush was writing. They&#8217;re obviously trying to make him look bad. It&#8217;s a direct attack against him if they knowingly did it. Someone obviously did because you can see where they blanked out the original text. It&#8217;s too white compared to the rest of the paper.

[Daily Pundit][4] filled me in on the Reuters explanation. [Little Green Footballs][5] has a couple updates.

I can&#8217;t believe they would actually use that photoshopped image in actual news articles. This is probably one of the most fucked up things we&#8217;ve seen from Reuters. I&#8217;ve lost what little respect I had for the MSM. This type of thing is just wrong.

**UPDATE:** I need to clarify a little it would seem. I fully understand that Reuters could have enhanced the image to make the text more readable. For those of you that say the note was shown to show Bush for the puppet he is, you&#8217;re wrong. He needs to show a certain level of diplomacy at meetings like that. He can&#8217;t just get up and go piss when he feels like it, it would offend someone.
