David Ulevitch, founder and CEO of [OpenDNS][1], sent me an email yesterday letting me know about a new feature from OpenDNS. It&#8217;s called [Shortcuts][2] and looks really sweet. Shortcuts are very simple, similar to bookmarks in your browser. Here&#8217;s how OpenDNS describes shortcuts:

> You type something short and easy to remember into your address bar and you leap straight to where you want to go. There&#8217;s nothing to install and it works how you want it to, no matter which browser you&#8217;re using. Add, remove or change your OpenDNS shortcuts at any time.

<!--adsense-->

  
Instead of going into any more detail about OpenDNS shortcuts, I&#8217;m gonna direct you over to [Paul Stamatiou][3]. Paul [already has a great post][4] with some screenshots and examples of shortcuts, go [check it out][4]. 

<div class="wpulike wpulike-default " >
  <div class="wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked">

					data-ulike-nonce="c2f25dc845"
					data-ulike-type="likeThis"
