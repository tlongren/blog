[<img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/farm2.static.flickr.com/1241/564953771_f4ffa7bbe1_t.jpg?resize=100%2C78" width="100" height="78" alt="reinvigorateSnoop" align="left" data-recalc-dims="1" />][1][Reinvigorate][2] has released [a tool called Snoop][3] that will stream live web stats to your desktop. For those of you who have never heard of Reinvigorate, it&#8217;s a website analytics solution similar to [Google Analytics][4]. Snoop includes some pre-defined events, such as new visitors and notification of returning visitors. You can also setup custom events. Custom events can be created on any website that supports JavaScript. Snoop is available for Windows and Mac currently, I&#8217;m hoping they have plans to build a GTK2 interface for Linux.  
<!--adsense-->

  
Snoop interacts with your Reinvigorate account, displaying current visitors and the pages they&#8217;re viewing in real time. It even displays comments if a reader posts a comment. Here&#8217;s some features available in Snoop:

> **Real-time Notification**  
> A dedicated asynchronous (non-polling) connection is maintained with Reinvigorate. You&#8217;ll know the instant someone makes a comment on your blog, posts in your forum, purchases an item, gets referred from another site, etc..
> 
> **Audible Events**  
> Each event triggers a unique sound. If you&#8217;re caught up in your work, or in another room, you don&#8217;t have to worry about missing events.
> 
> **Name Tag Integration**  
> Snoop features automatic integration with Name Tags so you&#8217;ll know exactly who your visitors are. 

I&#8217;ve been using Snoop on my Windows desktop at work for the last week or so and absolutely love it. I really wish there was some sort of interface for Linux so I could watch visitors at home. I&#8217;m NOT going to install Windows at home just so I can use Snoop, although it is tempting. ðŸ™‚
