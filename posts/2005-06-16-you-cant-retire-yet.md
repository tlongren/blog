I think I may have saw something on this a few days ago, but [Of the Mind brought it back][1] to my attention this morning.

Anyway, it seems some senators would like to [increase the retirement age in the U.S. to 69][2]. It&#8217;s currently at 65. To me, it really doesn&#8217;t matter. I&#8217;m not stupid enough to rely on [social security][3] to retire on. In fact, Michael, from [Of the Mind][4], thinks the way I do about this. Every penny I pay into social security I look at as a complete loss. I never expect to get that money back, and it really pisses me off.

Now, I&#8217;m ok with paying taxes, but not social security taxes as I&#8217;m not gonna get to see any of it. It&#8217;s totally bogus that all the working people in America are basically working to provide for the senior community, which is gonna be extinct in another 20 years or so.

Where&#8217;s that leave me? Poorer than I should be and very angry. Social Security should be gotten rid of for the sake of Americans that&#8217;ll be alive in 20 years. It&#8217;s not a real way for providing financial security to retired peoples. We should instead be teaching people good investment techniques and how to save their own damn money. I&#8217;ve managed to save $500 in about 3 weeks. Saving at least a few million by the time I&#8217;m 50 shouldn&#8217;t be a problem. Be sure that&#8217;s not all I&#8217;m going to rely on for financial security though. I plan to invest some of the money I&#8217;m currently saving. In what exactly, I dunno yet.

The Disabled Worker Law Blog [has a different view][5] on the news. And The Spoons Experience [doesn&#8217;t think the age will ever be changed][6].
