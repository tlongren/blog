I just don&#8217;t understand it. He&#8217;s bashing Bush for Bush&#8217;s stance on same-sex marriage, yet Kerry refuses to take a stance of his own. What a god damn hypocrite. If Kerry doesn&#8217;t have a stance on the issue, what right does he have to bash Bush&#8217;s stance? He needs to shut the fuck up and drop out of the race. I&#8217;m gonna be seriously pissed off if this jack ass gets elected. He looks more like a fucking robot than Gore did. God this man makes me mad!
