The most recent poll I posted here indicates that most HTML5Press users would like to see a lightbox-type effect built into HTML5Press.  


<div id="polls-4" class="wp-polls">
  <p style="text-align: center;">
    <strong>Would you like a lightbox-type effect built into HTML5Press?</strong>
  </p>
  
  <div id="polls-4-ans" class="wp-polls-ans">
    <ul class="wp-polls-ul">
      <li>
        Yes <small>(91%, 32 Votes)</small><div class="pollbar" style="width: 91%;" title="Yes (91% | 32 Votes)">
        </div>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        No <small>(9%, 3 Votes)</small><div class="pollbar" style="width: 9%;" title="No (9% | 3 Votes)">
        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>

    </p>
  </div>
  
  <input type="hidden" id="poll_4_nonce" name="wp-polls-nonce" value="a279b34ab0" />
</div>

<div id="polls-4-loading" class="wp-polls-loading">

I thought about adding a lightbox-type feature to HTML5Press with CSS3 but ended up settling on [Slimbox2 instead][1]. Slimbox2 is a very small clone of the popular [Lightbox][2] image overlay effect.

I have implemented slimbox2 for featured images mostly. So, if you click on a featured image when viewing a single post, the large image will show in the slimbox.

It will also work with images embedded directly in your posts. You won&#8217;t have to worry about adding rel=&#8221;lightbox&#8221; to your image links either, as I&#8217;ve [added some code to take care of that][3] automatically.

I haven&#8217;t officially released a new version of HTML5Press that includes this new feature, but if you&#8217;re interested you can [grab a development version of HTML5Press from Github][4].

You&#8217;ll need to enable the lightbox effect via the HTML5Press Options page in your WordPress Dashboard. The effect is turned off by default.
