I heard this on FoxNews yesterday morning. I&#8217;ve been following it at [The Jawa Report][1] since then basically.

And Iraq now has a fledgling democracy. And America clearly demonstrated its resolve to avenge the attacks of 9/11. But all that&#8217;s not important right now.

The fact that they riot over something NewsWeek said makes me laugh. I thought all those people were against the american news media. I thought they hated corporate american and everything it stands for. But when NewsWeek says something about their Koran, they riot. What happened to not caring about western news media? You shouldn&#8217;t even be listening to NewsWeek in the first place, it&#8217;s a western publication! This just goes to show that nobody can resist the power of the american news elite. Not even the jihadists that kill babies daily. ðŸ™‚
