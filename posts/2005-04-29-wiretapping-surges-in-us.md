> Court authorized wiretaps in the U.S. surged [19% in 2004 to 1,710][2]. Court orders relating to terror-related investigations are not included in the wiretap statistics and those warrants reached a record 1,754 last year. Apparently judges have found that law enforcement is unbelievably perfect as they rubber-stamped approvals on every single request they received.
