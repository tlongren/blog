## Boring but Useful Image Placeholders

There&#8217;s all types of image placeholder sites. Think of image placeholders as lorem ipsum, but for images instead of text. Some popular image placeholder services are [Dummy Image][1] and [placehold.it][2]. Both of those sites let you specify your image dimensions in the URL and then they will spit out an image in the requested dimensions.

Both are good services, and I&#8217;ve used Dummy Image extensively, especially while working for the [Ames Tribune][3]. As a newspaper, we used the [IAB standard ad sizes][4], which Dummy Image has built-in. So all we needed to do for a standard 300x250px IAB placeholder ad image is this:<figure class="wp-block-image">

![Dummy Image][5] </figure> 

That&#8217;ll produce the image below.  
  
Background color of the image is #222222 and the text color is set to #eeeeee.

## The Problem and Solutions

That&#8217;s fine and dandy, but **what if we need placeholder images that give more life to our mockups**? Like actual people, objects, and other organic stuff you find in the meatspace. Having dull placeholder images can give a bad first impression when meeting with new clients. Why not spice it up a bit and add some placeholder images that are somewhat relevant to the project at hand?

Also, flat, plain images simply don&#8217;t fit with some designs. Thankfully, this is where sites like [placekitten][6], [PlaceBeard.it][7] and [placezombie.com][8] come in.

These sites will give you actual photos for placeholder images, not just plain boxes with the image dimensions inside. The image attached to this post is a [placeholder image from Fill Murray][9]. Here&#8217;s a smaller placeholder image from Fill Murray, accomplished with this

## My Absolute Favorite Image Placeholder Service

[Placezombie.com][8]. I like zombies, my oldest daughter loves zombies. So, I decided to revived the now dead placezombies.com and got a new domain for it at [placezombie.com][11]. The original placezombies.com domain expired and someone else picked it up, unfortunately. I maintain placezombie.com and use it everywhere, I could be a bit partial to it, I suppose. ðŸ™‚

Placezombie.com does color placeholder images and greyscale placeholder images.

<div class="wp-block-image">
  <figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/longren.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/500x250.jpg"><img loading="lazy" width="500" height="250" src="https://i0.wp.com/longren.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/500x250.jpg?resize=500%2C250" alt="Color Image Placeholder" class="wp-image-8162" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.longren.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/500x250.jpg?w=500&ssl=1 500w, https://i2.wp.com/www.longren.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/500x250.jpg?resize=150%2C75&ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/www.longren.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/500x250.jpg?resize=300%2C150&ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption> Color Image Placeholder</figcaption></figure>
</div>

</div>

## Genre-Specific Image Placeholder Services

### 1. [PlaceBeard.it][12]

Only because I&#8217;ll be giving them a photo of me soon.

### 2. [Placekitten][6]

Kittens just bring a certain, I dunno, something to your early designs. They&#8217;re cute and usually quite fluffy.

### 3. [Flickrholdr][13]

There&#8217;s a ton of great photos on Flickr, so this isn&#8217;t really genre-specific, but it needs mentioned. Pull images based on tags to simplify finding images that are relevant to your current project.

### 4. [Placezombie.com][8]

I now maintain this site at https://placezombie.com. This one is a must if you&#8217;re building a horror or zombie related site. Some of the images might even be useful as production pieces.

### 5. [Placebear][14]

Like bears? So do I. As with most of these services, you can get your images in full color or in greyscale, and Placebear is no exception.

See below for a Placezombie example.

<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"></pre><figure class="wp-block-image">

![Placezombie 700x250px][15] </figure> 

## Novelty Image Placeholder Services

### 1. [Placecage][16]

Who doesn&#8217;t like Nick Cage? I particularly [like this one][17].

### 2. [Placesheen][18]

Charlie Sheen was everywhere a few months ago, why not memorialize him with an image placeholder service?

### 3. [Fill Murray][19]

I really like Bill Murray, so I could actually see myself using this service for personal projects where I don&#8217;t necessarily care if the images are of a certain genre.

### 4. [Nice Nice JPG!][20]

Can you guess who&#8217;s featured in this image placeholder service? Unfortunately, yes, the always pleasant Vanilla Ice. [Reminds me of the good old days.][21]

### 5. [Steven SeGALLERY][22]

I would never use this for anything, ever. And neither should you. But, if you must, don&#8217;t come bitching when you start dreaming of [Steven, with hair slicked back, pointing a gun at you][23] due to overexposure to Mr. Segal.

### 6. [Morgan Fillman][24]

You can never have enough Morgan Freeman in your sites. Just specify any size as per the examples below and make your website Mogan Freeman-tastic.  
I know Steven Segal has a pretty loyal following, but I think his followers even look at him as a joke, his acting career for sure. Since I&#8217;ve hated on Steven so much, here&#8217;s a placeholder image just for him, because I secretly watch his movies every chance I get.

<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"></pre><figure class="wp-block-image">

![Steven Segallery 650x300px][25] </figure> 

## Use Unsplash.com Images for Placeholders

[Sellaphix mentioned in the comments][26] an image placeholder service that&#8217;s driven by [Unsplash.com][27], called [Unsplash.it][28]. Pretty cool, definitely worth checking out. Unsplash.it even has the code that drives the site [available on GitHub][29]! You could roll your own, basically.

There&#8217;s a TON of image placeholder services around, there&#8217;s probably a few new ones being built right now. [Google &#8220;image placeholders&#8221;][30] and you could probably spend a few hours looking at various image placeholder services.

The ones I&#8217;ve listed are extremely easy to use and don&#8217;t require you to download anything. Just format your img tag as explained at each service and you&#8217;ll be set.

## A Quick Note

If you&#8217;re switching image placeholder services around, beware that some use different URL formats. For example, image URL&#8217;s at Placezombie are https://placezombie.com/700&#215;250. While others, like Fill Murray are formatted with a slash, like so http://www.fillmurray.com/700/250. So make sure you know what format the service you&#8217;re using is expecting.

## End

If you have any other image placeholder services that you use that weren&#8217;t mentioned, I&#8217;d love to hear what they are. You can comment below or [start a discussion at Hacker News][31].

## Update

In the comments, [Babak][32] mentioned [Loremflickr.com][33], and I love it! Check out [Loremflickr.com][33].
