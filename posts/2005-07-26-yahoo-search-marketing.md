Apparently some people are getting pretty angry over the performance of the Direct Traffic Center (DTC) piece of Yahoo Search Marketing (or Overture). As usual, the Search Engine Roundtable [brought this to my attention][1]. There&#8217;s even some guys wanting to pull their ads for 5 days in protest. They want something to change, I&#8217;d like some change in the DTC. Search Engine Roundtable has a list of 10 things some PPC managers want to change about the DTC. There&#8217;s also links to discussions about this on a couple forums.

I manage all our SEM stuff at work. I work with the DTC a lot, it&#8217;s crap. The Google Adwords interface is so much better and quicker. Reports can be easily customized in Adwords so you can get the info you need.

The DTC in Overture is slow. Brian took over managing our Overture/Yahoo account while I was in Colorado. He said the scheduled maintenance for Friday (7/22) evening. During that period, access to the DTC wouldn&#8217;t be available. I get into work Monday morning and I can&#8217;t get in. I had just gotten an e-mail from Overture warning our funds were getting low. No shit! Your DTC is down so it&#8217;s impossible to add funds! Sometime around 4:00pm CST yesterday I was finally able to login. And then it was slow as could be.

Other complaints I have with it are the reports. There&#8217;s only a few possible reports you can get. And they can&#8217;t really be customized. In Adwords you can choose what data to show for which adgroups and so forth. You can get a pretty much totally customized report in Adwords. The reporting in the Overture DTC is pathetic. You&#8217;re not even able to choose specific data to show as far as I can tell. EMP also [has a bit to add][2].
