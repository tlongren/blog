[Techcrunch has a good post][1] discussing the recent decision made (lastnight) by the US House. [House Resolution 5319][2] (the Deleting Online Predators Act, or DOPA) was passed lastnight with a vote of 410 to 15. If the resolution does indeed become law, schools and public libraries will lose federal internet subsidies if they don&#8217;t block social networking sites such as [MySpace][3] and [Newsvine][4].

Now, I&#8217;m all for keeping MySpace out of schools, it has no place there. But every social networking site shouldn&#8217;t be targeted, that&#8217;s just insane. That&#8217;s like banning all light bulbs because one manufacturer has problems with their light bulbs exploding. Stupid, stupid, stupid.

I&#8217;m very upset by this decision. [Go over to Techcrunch][1] to read more about it. They&#8217;ve also got links to many other sites that discuss HR5319 in greater detail.
