The &#8220;boylove&#8221; site discussed in [my previous post][1] has [been shut down][2]. I don&#8217;t think anyone would argue with that, except maybe &#8220;[Freedom][3]&#8220;.

[Stacy][4] informed me of the sites demise [in the comments][5] in that last post, I do appreciate the info provided by readers in comments very much. New sources are good, I don&#8217;t typically get a lot of my information from the Christian bloggers and religious community in general, so a change is nice I guess.

Now, this is just one of what&#8217;s likely to be many tens of thousands of &#8220;boylove&#8221; blogs. [Assorted Babble][6] rightly notes that parents need to be aware of their childrens online activity at all times. I&#8217;d expect to see some sort of group formed to start targetting some of the larger and more popular &#8220;boylove&#8221; blogs. Groups are how the blogosphere gets shit done.

I&#8217;m all for violating peoples right to free speech if they&#8217;re going to be discussing fantasies, that if acted out, would be 100% illegal. Some would say that isn&#8217;t free speech, but free speech isn&#8217;t unlimited. For instance, you can&#8217;t speak of bombs while on an airplane. This is the same type of thing. People shouldn&#8217;t be allowed to blog about their fantasies with small boys, no matter how much they believe it&#8217;s an OK act to engage in.

I think a few years of a &#8220;[Red Scare][7]&#8221; type scenario would do some good. I wish some people were afraid about how their views and opinions would be percieved by others. I&#8217;m exempt of course, because, uhh, I just am.

I&#8217;m by no means advocating for large scale government involvment in internet freedoms. As far as I&#8217;m concerned, they should stay out totally. It should be up to individual companies to include such content restrictions in the terms of service.

Oh, and this post has been linked at [Outside The Beltway][8] and [Mudville Gazette][9].
