[The Minutemen Project][1] has been arresting illegals crossing over from Mexico for tresspassing. They&#8217;re my heroes. [The Jawa Report says][2] the border patrol in Arizona has been ordered to stop arresting illegal aliens.

> This is not at all a surprise to me, but it is sickening nonetheless. Washington Times has learned that agents along the Arizona border were ordered to make the minimum number of arrests possible in order to diminish the positive effects the Minutemen have had.

And this is [from the Washington Times article][3]:

> U.S. Border Patrol agents have been ordered not to arrest illegal aliens along the section of the Arizona border where protesters patrolled last month because an increase in apprehensions there would prove the effectiveness of Minuteman volunteers, The Washington Times has learned. More than a dozen agents, all of whom asked not to be identified for fear of retribution, said orders relayed by Border Patrol supervisors at the Naco, Ariz., station made it clear that arrests were &#8220;not to go up&#8221; along the 23-mile section of border that the volunteers monitored to protest illegal immigration. [&#8230;] Border Patrol Chief David V. Aguilar at the agency&#8217;s Washington headquarters called the accusations &#8220;outright wrong,&#8221; saying that supervisors at the Naco station had not blocked agents from making arrests and that the station&#8217;s 350 agents were being &#8220;supported in carrying out&#8221; their duties.

So, so stupid. The Minutemen are awesome. I wish I could join them. The criminals that run this country need to be gotten rid of. They don&#8217;t do their jobs, they shouldn&#8217;t be getting paid. The number of illegals in this country is becoming more and more of a problem. It&#8217;s been very obvious here in Nevada, Iowa for a couple years now.
