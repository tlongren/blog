A marine, recently assigned to the staff of Vice President Dick Cheney, is suspected of spying from within the White House for nearly 3 years. I read this at [The Jawa Report][1] lastnight before I went to bed.

Apparently this story has been around for nearly a month. [PunditGuy][2] reports that ABC News is investigating a possible White House angle. Below is from [ABC News][3].

> Officials tell ABC News the alleged spy worked undetected at the White House for almost three years. Leandro Aragoncillo, 46, was a U.S. Marine most recently assigned to the staff of Vice President Dick Cheney.
> 
> &#8220;I don&#8217;t know of a case where the vetting broke down before and resulted in a spy being in the White House,&#8221; said Richard Clarke, a former White House advisor who is now an ABC News consultant.
> 
> Federal investigators say Aragoncillo, a naturalized citizen from the Philippines, used his top secret clearance to steal classified intelligence documents from White House computers.
> 
> In 2000, Aragoncillo worked on the staff of then-Vice President Al Gore. When interviewed by Philippine television, he remarked how valued Philippine employees were at the White House.

The marines name is Leandro Aragoncillo, age 46 and originally from the Philippines. A whole bunch of goodies could have been stolen in a 3 year period of time, mostly just really sensitive data. [PunditGuy][2] also has a bunch of information on this guy, he&#8217;s got the most all-inclusive post.

Other coverage in the blogosphere coming from Jay at [Stop The ACLU][4], [Riehl World View][5], and [The Political Teen][6] has a video.
