Valerie Plame has [filed a lawsuit][1] against Karl Rove, Dick Cheney, and I. Lewis &#8220;Scooter&#8221; Libby. She and husband Joe Wilson are claiming their exposure was intentional and malicious, and was done in an attempt to destroy their careers. Here&#8217;s a bit from [the article at CNN][2]:

> The lawsuit accuses Cheney, Libby, Rove and 10 unnamed administration officials or political operatives of putting the Wilsons and their children&#8217;s lives at risk by exposing Plame.
> 
> &#8220;This lawsuit concerns the intentional and malicious exposure by senior officials of the federal government of &#8230; (Plame), whose job it was to gather intelligence to make the nation safer and who risked her life for her country,&#8221; the Wilsons&#8217; lawyers said in the lawsuit.
> 
> Libby is the only administration official charged in connection with the leak investigation. He faces trial in January on perjury and obstruction-of-justice charges, accused of lying to FBI agents and a federal grand jury about when he learned Plame&#8217;s identity and what he subsequently told reporters.

There&#8217;s already lots of discussion on this:  
[Wizbang][3]  
[Stop the ACLU][4]  
[Outside The Beltway][5]  
[bRight & Early][6]  
[Hot Air][7]

All those sites have all the details, I won&#8217;t bother re-stating the facts. I&#8217;m not really sure how I feel about this, but it seems like something Valerie and Joe wouldn&#8217;t want to get themselves into voluntarily. Won&#8217;t this additional attention just put them and their family at greater risk?
