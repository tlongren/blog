Yay! The threat level in the U.S. has been raised to Orange (High Risk). What&#8217;s that mean to me? Nothing.

How can the [DHS][1] expect people to take this seriously for much longer? I didn&#8217;t take it seriously to begin with. They never provide any evidence to support the change in threat level. Never. Tom Ridge always gives some bull-shit, ambiguous evidence that doesn&#8217;t really mean anything. It sounds like he&#8217;s just guessing there&#8217;s a reason to raise the threat level. Heh..threat level.
