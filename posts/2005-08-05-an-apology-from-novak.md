Robert Novak, well known columnist and reporter, stormed off the set of Inside Politics on CNN. The video is quite amusing. Novack says &#8220;I think that&#8217;s bullshit and I hate that&#8221; while he&#8217;s mock slapping James Carville. Mr. Carville incited the whole thing I believe. James Carville gets on my nerves. I can&#8217;t really watch him. Personally, I think he&#8217;s not from this planet&#8230;

Anyway, Novak issued an apology today, saying &#8220;I apologize for my conduct and I&#8217;m sorry I did it.&#8221; CNN isn&#8217;t letting him on air anymore for a while. Novak said &#8220;I&#8217;ll follow their guidance&#8221;, not like he has a choice or anything.

Captain&#8217;s Quarters [has an update][1] that pretty much sums the whole thing up. Kevin at Wizbang has [some interesting things to say][2] about the book that&#8217;s on the table before Novak walks off. And the great Dr. Rusty Shackleford thinks Novak is [just a whiny bitch][3]. Pretty amusing.
