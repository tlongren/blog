I recently made a [post over at the VPSstat.us blog][1] just letting folks know what&#8217;s going on and why there&#8217;s bee such a delay in getting our product out there for everyone to use. Rather than go into that again, just checkout the post at the VPSstat.us Blog.

The gist of it is, a friend and I have been working on a new startup idea. [Kegplan.io][2], a SaaS business that helps liquor stores to better manage their kegs, with many additional features in the pipeline. Ace (the friend), who runs I-35 Spirits in Ankeny, IA, was the inspiration for the idea. Managing kegs, such as pick up dates, return dates, weather or not the customer needs a tapper, etc, can be a real time drain. Most liquor store owners have much, much better things they could be doing.

We&#8217;re almost ready to release a private beta and invite some local liquor stores to try it out. &#8220;Local&#8221; being in Iowa, Central Iowa preferably, but that doesn&#8217;t mean we won&#8217;t leave Iowa if we can get a few potential customers lined up out of state.

There&#8217;s a very, very basic homepage up now at <http://kegplan.io>. Please forgive me for it&#8217;s ugliness, most of my time so far has been spent developing the software that&#8217;s installed on customer sites. I&#8217;ll be hitting kegplan.io pretty hard in the next few weeks, including incorporating [Pure CSS][3] to make development a bit faster, and also provide full responsiveness.

Below is an overview of how to integrate kegplan.io into your website:

  1. Signup for a kegplan.io account
  2. Choose a plan (beta will be totally free, no cc details required)
  3. Choose the keg beers that your store has available from our admin interface, or send us a spreadsheet and we&#8217;ll import it just for you
  4. Install our script on the page on your site you&#8217;d like to have the keg request form
  5. That&#8217;s it! Direct customers to the page you installed the script on and they&#8217;ll be able to submit keg requests. Requests are sent to your email and also stored in a database so you can have all sorts of neat reports and graphs.

Since this is a service that can immediately have a positive impact on businesses, and a friends business specifically, I&#8217;m focusing on getting [kegplan.io][4] launched before putting more work into [VPSstat.us][5]. Kegplan is a relatively simple piece of software so getting it production ready shouldn&#8217;t take more than a couple of weeks.

All the scripts that are installed on customer websites are hosted on [Heroku][6] for maximum availability. The customer control panel is hosted on [a pretty beefy VPS from DigitalOcean][7]. We may eventually switch to using DigitalOcean&#8217;s private networking with a few different VPS&#8217;s in different locations, but I have a feeling Heroku will be plenty sufficient.

Shortly before the private beta release, we&#8217;ll be integrating kegplan.io into [i35spirits.com][8]. Once it&#8217;s been thoroughly tested on i35spirits.com, we&#8217;ll drop the private beta. If you&#8217;re interested in more info or if you want to get in the private beta right away, email me (Tyler) at `tyler at kegplan dot io`.

If you&#8217;ve got any suggestions on the best, most secure way to deliver scripts for installation on third-party websites, I&#8217;d love to hear your thoughts. Right now I&#8217;m including a script on customer sites that&#8217;s delivered via HTTPS, and basically prints the form on the customer website. And I&#8217;m using jQuery and AJAX to send the results back to an SSL enabled domain for storage in a database and to send the necessary notification emails.

Anyway, keep checking [kegplan.io][2] for updates. There&#8217;ll be a official kegplan.io blog eventually, but right now all announcements will be made here at longren.org, and maybe at the [I-35 Spirits website][9].

Would love to hear any comments. If you know anyone who runs a liquor store or other establishment that sells kegs, please tell them about us! We&#8217;re new at this too, so we&#8217;ll be helping beta users through every step of the on-boarding process.

Please bear with us as we finish out the customer-facing <http://kegplan.io> website. I don&#8217;t have a lot of time to work on it, other than nights and some weekends, but there&#8217;s not a _whole_ lot to do.
