Slackware 11.0.0 is really feeling &#8220;official&#8221; now for me. Yesterday, Patrick made an [update to the -current ChangeLog][1] stating he had bumped the /etc/slackware-version number up to 11.0.0. I had been waiting for him to bump that version number up. Now that he&#8217;s done so, I know Slackware 11.0 will be out soon. I am excited.
