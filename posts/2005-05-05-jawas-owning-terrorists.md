One of [Rusty&#8217;s][1] readers helped jail a terrorist. It&#8217;s a pretty neat story, not all the details have been released yet however. Rusty got all excited and wrote &#8220;fucking&#8221; in the post. So if that offends you, don&#8217;t read. heh.

> The basic story is we posted a terrorist&#8217;s e-mail. A reader with an Arabic sounding e-mail address sent off a message to the terrorist. The terrorist responded. The FBI was informed. The FBI didn&#8217;t do diddly-squat. The reader kept bugging the FBI. The FBI finally investigated, and &#8230;&#8230; drumroll please &#8230;.. the FBI now has said terrorist locked up in a jail.

You should really [read the rest][2] because the above quote is only a small piece of the post.
