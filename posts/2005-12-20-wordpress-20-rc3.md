So, I didn&#8217;t post for WordPress 2.0-RC2, although there was a far greater number of changes in RC2 than there is in RC3. But, RC2 is history now, so screw it. Sounds like this [could be the final release candidate][1] before WordPress 2.0 is officially out of beta and ready for &#8220;production&#8221; use.

> The next release of WordPress is drawing near. Please help us shake out any last remaining bugs by downloading and testing the 2.0 Release Candidate. If all goes well, the Release Candidate will become 2.0 final. Weâ€™re almost there. Download, test, and head over to the Beta Forum to let us know if the Release Candidate is ready for prime time.

I&#8217;ve got release candidate 3 running here right now, no problems at all. On a related note, [Spam Karma][2] 2.0 informed me of 2.1 being in beta. Can&#8217;t seem to find a link to it now though.
