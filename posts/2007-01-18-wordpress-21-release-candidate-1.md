WordPress 2.1 Release Candidate 1 is out. Ryan Boren [has the details][1] over on his blog. There&#8217;s [a list of changes in 2.1][2] at the WordPress codex, as well as [a list of plugins that are compatible][3] with WordPress 2.1.

If you&#8217;re using WordPress 2.1 RC1, you can give feedback via the [testers mailing list][4] or at the [forum for beta releases][5].

The WordPress developers are already thinking about WordPress 2.2. With 2.2 they&#8217;re gonna start doing [time based releases][1], trying to release every four months:

> With 2.2 weâ€™re going to start doing time based releases. Weâ€™re going to try to do a release every four months and limit the scope of the changes to what we can realistically achieve within that timeframe. The goal is to get cool new features into userâ€™s hands more often instead of saving them up for the one big release every year.
