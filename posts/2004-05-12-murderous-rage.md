After seeing the beheading of Nick Berg, and seeing a picture of his supposed killer on T.V., I felt the un-deniable urge to kill him. I know it&#8217;s wrong, and will never be acted out, but I would have absolutely no problem taking this guys life. It would be an honor to take this mans life.

He and his 4 ass goblin friends show absolutely no regard for human life or any kind of moral decency. I&#8217;m suprised and somewhat disappointed there hasn&#8217;t been more fallout from this. I would expect more people to be absolutely outraged at this. The lack of outrage is probably due to not many people viewing the entire video&#8230;it&#8217;s not an easy thing to see.

I&#8217;m not a killer, so don&#8217;t send me any hate mail about this.
