Ok, still no luck with the comments. I got the page to load data lastnight, but at that point it wasn&#8217;t inserting the comments into the database. I downloaded the latest development release of WordPress lastnight from Subversion and copied the wp-comments-post.php page to my working WordPress directory, but that didn&#8217;t fix anything. I then copied the relavent functions.php file from the devel trunk, and then WordPress ceased to function at all.

I&#8217;m not even sure if it&#8217;s an error on the wp-comments-post.php page or if it&#8217;s in one of the functions&#8230;I almost think it&#8217;s in the function that&#8217;s used to insert data for a comment. 

<div class="wpulike wpulike-default " >
  <div class="wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked">
    <button type="button"
					aria-label="Like Button"
					data-ulike-id="1776"
					data-ulike-nonce="4474a8b246"
					data-ulike-type="likeThis"
					data-ulike-template="wpulike-default"
					data-ulike-display-likers="0"
					data-ulike-disable-pophover="0"
					class="wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_likethis_1776"></button><span class="count-box"></span>
  </div>
