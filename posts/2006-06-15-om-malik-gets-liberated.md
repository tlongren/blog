Om Malik, the guy behind the [GigaOm blog][1], is setting out on his own. He&#8217;s leaving Business 2.0 to create a news related site of his own. Om&#8217;s blog, GigaOm, has been one of my daily reads for the last year and a half or more.

It appears [Om has raised][2] several hundred thousand dollars from venture capital firm [True Ventures][3].

I&#8217;m pretty sure Om will be successful with his new start-up. As you can imagine, I&#8217;m [not the only one][4] feeling this way.
