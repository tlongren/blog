Joel Comm has created a pretty [neat AdSense game][1]. Basically, it&#8217;s a game focused on making money with your website through AdSense.

> I thought it would be fun to put together an online game focused on making money with AdSense, and I&#8217;m pleased to invite you to come and try out The AdSense Game now!
> 
> Be sure to follow the instructions so you can get the hang of it quickly. Realize that it is just a simulation and not real life. It&#8217;s there for fun, but you may learn a thing or two along the way!

Joel has a [post on his blog about the game][2] in which he gives a few useful links to those who enjoy playing the AdSense game.

Looks like it could be pretty fun, but I think I&#8217;ll stick with the real AdSense &#8220;game&#8221;, this site. The AdSense game is comparable to games like Lemonade Tycoon and Rollercoaster Tycoon.
