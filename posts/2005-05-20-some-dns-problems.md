This site was experiencing some DNS issues lastnight that made it unavailble for most of the night. These problems have since been resolved and it should all be working again. Not really sure what caused the problems in the first place. I think [EveryDNS][1] might have been having some problems that caused it. EveryDNS is where I host my DNS. They have an awesome setup! I wish hosting providers would let you manage your own DNS like EveryDNS does. EveryDNS should try selling their interface to hosting companes, I bet they could make a killing. They even have dynamic DNS.
