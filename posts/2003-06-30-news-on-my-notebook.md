I&#8217;ve been working for the past 24 hours at a client site in Des Moines. We&#8217;ve been migrating them from NT 4.0 to Windows 2000. While my boss, Jeremy, was on the phone with Microsoft tech support, I decided to call Sony to see about getting my notebook fixed. They said it was still under warranty so they&#8217;re going to send me a box and a packaging list. They said the materials should arrive around Wednesday. So my notebook should be fixed within the next few weeks. Hopefully Sony&#8217;s repair service isn&#8217;t as pathetic as IBM&#8217;s (and many other places).
