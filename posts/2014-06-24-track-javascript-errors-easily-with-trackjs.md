I&#8217;ve been using [Track:js][1] for a few weeks now here at longren.io.

There may seem like a lot of GoogleBot-related errors at first glance. But, after deleting or filtering those out, you&#8217;re left with the errors that _really_ happen most often.

[Track:js][1] has also recently added an option that will send you a daily summary of the JavaScript errors encountered, which is really handy, especially when you don&#8217;t have time to monitor the Track:js dashboard all day long.

A summary email can be seen below:  
[<img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/longren.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/trackjs-daily-email-1024x625.png?resize=700%2C427" alt="Track:js Daily Email Summary" width="700" height="427" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7112" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.longren.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/trackjs-daily-email.png?resize=1024%2C625&ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/www.longren.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/trackjs-daily-email.png?resize=150%2C91&ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/www.longren.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/trackjs-daily-email.png?resize=300%2C183&ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.longren.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/trackjs-daily-email.png?w=1408&ssl=1 1408w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-recalc-dims="1" />][2]

I really enjoy the service, but I can&#8217;t see myself paying for it, at least not until I have a viable product of my own that is worthy of being tracked in such detail. Track:js starts out at $29.99 a month, which will get you 500,000 hits per month and 8 days worth of error history.

The [guys behind Track:js are pretty awesome][3] and seem to be pretty involved in the tech startup scene here in the Midwest. The footer of their site reads &#8220;Proudly built in Minnesota&#8221;.
