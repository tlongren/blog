Who&#8217;s gonna win the online music wars, who will win the digital music player market, who will win the desktop. Who gives a fuck!

C|net needs to stop publishing shit like this. Why can&#8217;t companies share a market? Obviously they share, but C|net and other similar sites lead their readers to want a &#8220;winner&#8221;. There&#8217;s no winner, nobody will ever &#8220;win&#8221;. C|net always has linux articles, yet here they seem to be promoting monopolies on invidual markets.

There&#8217;s been shit loads of articles similar to the one mentioned above lately. Like there&#8217;s gonna be a winner. These journalists today need to re-think their career choices.
