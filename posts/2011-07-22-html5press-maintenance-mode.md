Took a break on making changes to HTML5Press for a couple weeks. Now that [1.8 has been out][1] for a while, I decided to get back to adding features.

I&#8217;ve added an option to the HTML5Press options page [that will allow you to enable maintenance mode][2] for your site. This will let you show a message to visitors letting them know your site is under maintenance. This will be helpful while making changes to your site or while tinkering with HTML5Press. Your site will still be visible to logged in users, but visitors will receive the message. This is achieved using [the wp_die WordPress function][3].

<div id="polls-3" class="wp-polls">
  <p style="text-align: center;">
    <strong>Is the "maintenance mode" option in HTML5Press a good idea?</strong>
  </p>
  
  <div id="polls-3-ans" class="wp-polls-ans">
    <ul class="wp-polls-ul">
      <li>
        Yes <small>(78%, 7 Votes)</small><div class="pollbar" style="width: 78%;" title="Yes (78% | 7 Votes)">
        </div>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        No <small>(22%, 2 Votes)</small><div class="pollbar" style="width: 22%;" title="No (22% | 2 Votes)">
        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p style="text-align: center;">
      Total Voters: <strong>9</strong>
    </p>
  </div>
  
  <input type="hidden" id="poll_3_nonce" name="wp-polls-nonce" value="aeb2c423aa" />
</div>

<div id="polls-3-loading" class="wp-polls-loading">
  <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.longren.io/wp-content/plugins/wp-polls/images/loading.gif?resize=16%2C16&#038;ssl=1" width="16" height="16" alt="Loading ..." title="Loading ..." class="wp-polls-image" data-recalc-dims="1" />&nbsp;Loading ...
</div>

Also, [featured images are now included][4] in the RSS feed. And on attachment pages (photos usually), there&#8217;s now [a link back to the post][5] those items are attached to.
