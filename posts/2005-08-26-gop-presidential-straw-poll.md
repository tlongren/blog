[Patrick Ruffini][1] has been running a GOP presidential straw poll. With 16539 votes, the results have been calculated. In the lead, with 29.9% is former NYC Mayor Rudy Giuliani. 26.32% of Iowans voted for Giuliani, out of 95 total Iowans taking the poll.

Lookin [at the data][2], Rudy came out on top in pretty much every state.

Patrick Ruffini has the rest of the results. I won&#8217;t bother writing anymore cuz he&#8217;s got [everything you could want to know][3] about the poll.
