The left is taking full advantage of Katrina for their [Bush-bashing agenda][1]. All of their theories so far basically revolve around Bush &#8220;stealing&#8221; money away from the New Orleans levee system to fund the war in Iraq.

Too bad for them the [U.S. Army Corps of Engineers came out today][2] stating that _&#8220;the decision to build levees for a Category 3 hurricane was made decades ago based on a cost-benefit analysis.&#8221;_ Tell that to any lefty and they&#8217;ll refute the evidence as though it doesn&#8217;t even exist. All the links above go to Rob&#8217;s Say Anything. 

Along with stealing money away from the New Orleans levee system, Bush also brought this on by not having strict enough environmental regulations. Not really, but that&#8217;s what the left would have you think. It&#8217;s not like Katrina was a freak of nature that was produced due to crappy environmental conditions. It was a level 4 hurricane when it hit the coast.

And how are they gonna blame current president Bush for the environment? The environment doesn&#8217;t change just like that in 6 years. These changes occur very slowly over a long period of time. So, even if Bush did tighten pollution laws, we probably wouldn&#8217;t see the desired effects for 30 or 40 years. I was listening to Cindy Sheehan blame all this on Bush the other night. She was taking the &#8220;Bush destroyed our clean atmosphere and is causing all these freak storms to pop up out of now where&#8221; stance. She&#8217;s totally off her rocker. And that picture of her with Rev. Al Sharpton bout made me noxious.

Others speaking about the politicizing of Katrina include [Blogs for Bush][3] and [Patrick Ruffini][4]. Both are very worthwhile reads.

So, enough of that for now. I&#8217;ll continue with some updated Katrina news. [Outside The Beltway][5] is reporting that a massive explosion ripped through New Orleans this morning. The explosion was at some sort of chemical depot. Apparently a huge fire is now burning. James also has news of the Louisiana governor ordering National Guard troops to [shoot and kill looters][6]. This could end up being a huge deal. I have to wonder if the National Guard will really shoot and kill looters. Some will probably refuse the orders. I for one never thought I&#8217;d witness National Guard troops opening fire on American citizens. But, times definately aren&#8217;t &#8220;typical&#8221; down there.

[HurricAid][7] has a link to a [scanner feed][8] from New Orleans. I&#8217;ve been listening to it for the last half an hour or so. A few minutes ago some guy was on there saying they&#8217;re getting ready to drop a bunch of cell phones to people. Not sure if the people were at the convention center or what. And they just had some kid on there that&#8217;s looking for his dad. They ended up giving the kid a phone number of the shelter his father was at.

[Riehl World View][9] has reports of a 5.1 magnitude earthquake in southern California. Unfortunately there&#8217;s not really much information on that at this time.
