I&#8217;ve been using Dropbox for a very long time. I would totally [replace Dropbox with Minus][1] if Minus supported adding a &#8220;local&#8221; folder to your system like Dropbox does. Unfortunately Minus does not offer that yet, but I hear they&#8217;re working on it.

Dropbox has released new beta versions of the Dropbox client. This beta client adds a new feature for auto-uploading photos and videos from your phone to Dropbox. For every 500MB you upload through this auto-upload feature, Dropbox will give you an additional 500MB of storage, for up to 5GB of additional storage.

I had a few GB worth of photos and videos on my phone to upload, so getting that extra 5GB was really easy for me. If you don&#8217;t have enough photos or videos to upload, just grab some online and put them into your phone&#8217;s picture/video folder. When I started, I had 2.5GB of free storage, I now have 7.5GB.

If you have yet to get a Dropbox account, [you can get one here][2].

You can find the beta Android client at [this post on the Dropbox forum][3].

You can also get this 5GB of additional storage with the beta Windows client. You can download the beta Windows client from [this post on the Dropbox forum][4]. There&#8217;s builds for OS X and Linux as well, but the auto upload feature only works in Windows currently.
