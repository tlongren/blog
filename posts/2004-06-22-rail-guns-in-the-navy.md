Yeah! In 2011, the U.S. Navy is slated to come out with integrated power system (IPS)/electric drive warships. These ships will be known as the DD(X). Anyway, these ships will supposedly boast rail guns. Anyone who&#8217;s ever played Quake should know what these are. In Quake, when person is shot with a rail gun, their body literally explodes. It&#8217;s sort of a difficult weapon to use in Quake, cuz your shot has to be right on. The rail guns the navy is talking about will have the ability to shoot 250+ miles.

Railguns are typically microwave, laser, or electromagnetic-kinetic weapons. It all sounds really neat:
