Curt at [Flopping Aces][1] linked to an interesting [opinion piece][2] discussing the Paris riots and the economic policies that caused them.

> Through a combination of socialism at home and appeasement abroad, the French believed they had found a viable alternative to, in former Prime Minister Lionel Jospin&#8217;s phrase, &#8220;jungle capitalism,&#8221; as practiced by you know who. Jacques Chirac was more direct, condemning &#8220;ultra liberal Anglo-Saxon&#8221; economic policies, while also famously boasting that France would anchor a European pole in a &#8220;multipolar&#8221; world, with American influence vastly reduced. With 300 French cities in flames, French pretensions lie singed and shriveled.

The article places most of the blame soley on economic factors and Frances willingness to accept immigrants. Economic factors do play a factor, no doubt. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s the root of the problem though, it all goes back to radical Islam. Curt [gets it][1]:

> While I agree that the French economic policies are a factor in the Paris riots, how do you explain the rioting in Germany and Belgium? You let Muslims take over neighborhoods in your country, almost giving them autonomy, then as soon as they get strong enough they will let you know that Islam has no borders and they will take the land by force. Radical Islam has no other goal then the destruction of the west, get it through your thick skulls liberals.
