Well, Sinclair Broadcast Group stations (at least here in Iowa) are no longer being carried by Mediacom. KCCI (cbs affiliate) had cameras outside a Mediacom office in Des Moines over the weekend. Thousands of people showed up to Mediacom offices to get a set of bunny ears so they can watch KDSM Fox 17 over the air.  
<!--adsense-->

  
Mediacoms [antenna supply was drained][1] due to the number of customers that showed up. KCCI says they checked with several local retailers, including Best Buy, Wal-Mart, and Target, to see if they had any antennas available. None of those stores had any antennas in stock when KCCI checked. Mediacom was giving them away for free, so they should have expected a pretty large turnout. It was really encouraging to see so many people out there. It just shows how many people are supporting Mediacom and choosing not to switch to DirecTV or another satellite provider.

[Commenter BobH][2] got his free antenna from Mediacom. However, KDSM Fox 17 (I assume) is the only station he can&#8217;t pick up over the air. I&#8217;m in the same boat he is. When I try to get KDSM Fox 17 over the air, all I see is snow. I thought KDSM had a decent over the air broadcast range, but they obviously don&#8217;t. I&#8217;m no more than 40 miles from Des Moines.

Hopefully Mediacom will keep pushing Sinclair to make a deal. I&#8217;m betting Sinclair will notice the negative effects this will have on their stations fairly soon.
