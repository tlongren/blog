Ashley and I both managed to get a week off work for vacation this last week. We spent the week (7/21/2007 &#8211; 7/28/2007) in Northport, Michigan with the Davis family, that&#8217;s Ashley&#8217;s mothers side. I can&#8217;t even begin to explain how nice it was to have a week off work. We both had a great time in Michigan, except for the visit to [Mackinac Island][1]. I could not believe the number of people on that island, way too many for me to deal with.

We stayed the entire week at [Northport Bay Retreat][2], a gigantic property that&#8217;s owned by Mike Anton (Anton & Co). Anton owns another property on Spider Lake, also in Michigan, that we&#8217;re hoping to get for the next reunion. We actually tried to get [the Spider Lake location][3] for this reunion but weren&#8217;t able to. The Spider Lake location is a much better fit for our group than the Northport Bay location, for multiple reasons that I won&#8217;t go in to here. Ash and I took [a few pictures][4] while in Michigan, but not nearly as many as I would have liked.

I did a little work on Unwakeable 2.0 while we were in Michigan. I&#8217;ve continued work on 2.0 since returning and have it very close to being ready for release. Unwakeable 2.0 will include some new styling options. For example, you can choose custom colors to use in the header and you can also customize sidebars. Unwakeable 2.0 includes the ability to choose from no sidebar, a single sidebar, or dual sidebars. Unwakeable 2.0 can also be set to fixed or flexible width. Flexible width will let Unwakeable adjust itself to fill most of the browser window.

I&#8217;ve also built sidebar modules for [Gregarious][5], [WP-PostRatings][6], and [WP-PostViews][6]. This will allow you to use those plugins in your dynamic sidebar provided you have the plugins installed and activated. Also, support for the [LMB^Box Comment Quicktags plugin][7] is included. All you have to do is download and activate the plugin and it will automatically start working with Unwakeable.

I expect I&#8217;ll be releasing Unwakeable 2.0 within 2 weeks, need to get some more testing done before releasing it to the wild though. Please note that Unwakeable 2.0 can only be used with WordPress 2.1 or later. If you&#8217;re using WordPress 2.0, Unwakeable will not work.
