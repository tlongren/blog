[Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft][1] have all agreed on a [standard specification][2] for sitemap files. Information about the new standard can be found [over at sitemaps.org][3]. If you&#8217;re not sure what a sitemap is, sitemaps.org has a nice explanation:

> Sitemaps are an easy way for webmasters to inform search engines about pages on their sites that are available for crawling. In its simplest form, a Sitemap is an XML file that lists URLs for a site along with additional metadata about each URL (when it was last updated, how often it usually changes, and how important it is, relative to other URLs in the site) so that search engines can more intelligently crawl the site.

<!--adsense-->

  
Fortunately for me, there&#8217;s really nothing I have to do to take advantage of this new spec. I&#8217;ve had a sitemap file for quite a while, and it gets updated dynamically with every new post I make. My [sitemap xml file is quite large][4].

[Joseph Scott][5] brings up an important aspect of this new spec, pinging. Pinging basically means that when you make an update to your blog or site, you can ping Google/Yahoo/MSN to let them know you&#8217;ve made an update. That way they can crawl your site sooner to index your new content. Pretty neat.
