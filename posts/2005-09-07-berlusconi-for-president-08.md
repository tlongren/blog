Too bad it can&#8217;t happen. He seems like the type of guy that wouldn&#8217;t put up with islamocrat lefties sympathizing with the enemies. I mean, he came out and said [western culture is superior to that of islam][1].

> The West is morally better than the Islamic world and will prevail, eventually. That in a nutshell is what Italian Prime M Silvio Berlusconi said while on a visit to the German capital Berlin. He made these comments in a conversation with journalists just before a press conference with German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder. Berlusconi literally said: We must be aware of the superiority of our civilisation, a system that has guaranteed well-being, respect for human rights and â€“ in contrast with Islamic countries &#8211; respect for religious and political rights.&#8221;
> 
> The Western civilisation is superior, Mr Berlusconi added, because &#8220;it has at its core &#8211; as its greatest value &#8211; freedom, which is not the heritage of Islamic culture&#8221;. The Italian prime minister predicted that &#8220;the West will continue to conquer peoples, even if it means a confrontation with another civilisation, Islam, firmly entrenched where it was 1400 years ago&#8221;.
