## More Responsive Tables, for Twitter Bootstrap this time, but not necessarily. From [@nadangergeo][1] & [@filamentgroup][2]! {.subtitle}

I made a [post the other day][3] about the responsive table plugins provided by TableSaw. They&#8217;re nice, but if you&#8217;re using Twitter Bootstrap (like I and many, many others do), [RWD-Table Patterns][4] may suit you better. There&#8217;s [a demo here][5].

It&#8217;s mobile first, and is made with Twitter Bootstrap, although you can remove Bootstrap in your own fork if you wish. [Usage instructions can be found][6] at the demo page, and at the [the GitHub repository][7].

A list of features:

### Made for Twitter Bootstrap

> Designed to be used with Bootstrap 3. If you don&#8217;t want to use bootstrap, just fork the repo and customize it to your needs!

### Mobile first & PE

> Built with mobile first and progressive enhancement in mind. Also built with love and with the help of a fair amount of coffee.

### Graceful JS fallback

> In browsers without JavaScript, the tables will still be scrollable. I.e. there&#8217;s still some responsiveness.

### Easy to use

> You only need to add one JS-file, one CSS-file and some minimal setup to make the tables responsive. Dependencies: jQuery and Twitter Bootstrap 3.

If you&#8217;re really in need of responsive tables, this could be another option for you, so it&#8217;s at least [worth knowing about and checking out][4].
