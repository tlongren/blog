So, North Korea finally admitted to having nukes. Big deal. Their reasoning for having them is for &#8220;protection&#8221; from Bush&#8217;s offensive tactics. I think they should be allowed to have them. Who the fuck are we to tell them they can&#8217;t? They&#8217;re not a democratic country, so fuck it.

I think it&#8217;s good of them to keep some for protection. Bush wants N. Korea to get rid of their nukes, if they don&#8217;t, he&#8217;d like to attack them. If I was N. Korea, there&#8217;s no way I&#8217;d give up my nukes. I mean, they&#8217;re for protection from America essentially. If we don&#8217;t antagonize them by pressing them to get rid of their nukes, we&#8217;ll all be fine. They wouldn&#8217;t have a need for nukes for &#8220;protection&#8221; if they didn&#8217;t see Bush as such a threat. It&#8217;s no different than the U.S. building nukes to protect us from the &#8220;terrorists&#8221;, which I believe more and more is my own government.
