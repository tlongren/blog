[Crossposted from Stop The ACLU][1]

[Stop The ACLU][2] was started on February 9th, 2004. We started with high hopes, and we realized we were facing a goliath. There were many reasons why we thought the ACLU needed to be countered, and they are numerous. We wanted to provide a way to inform the public of the ACLU&#8217;s agenda, as the MSM sugar coated it. We wanted to be a central database for people to gather, exchange ideas, and get actively involved in real ways of stopping them. It is a monumental task, exhausting, time consuming, and often frustrating. But it is a fight worth fighting.

We would be nothing without our supporters. To all of you, we appreciate the continued support. We have called you to action and you have answered. We raised $2,500.00 for an ad in the Washington Times, and I want to announce at this time that the check is in the mail as of Wednessday, Nov 8th. The ad should appear within the next two weeks. When it does, it will be scanned, and put up at [Stop The ACLU][2] for all to see. We will call you to action again, and again, and it is good to know that you will answer the call because you believe in this cause.

The ACLU have been laying low lately, but that is no reason to grow complacent. It is now that we should prepare to counter them. The Christmas season is around the corner, and the ACLU will be full force. Get involved in [Operation Nativity.][3]

There are many reasons to stop the ACLU. For this blogburst I decided to list my top ten list.

10. The [ACLU was founded by Communist][4], with communist ideals, communist goals, and they continue to impose a Communist like agenda on America daily. The founder of the ACLU, Roger Baldwin stated clearly&#8230;

> My chief aversion is the system of greed, private profit, privilege and violence which makes up the control of the world today, and which has brought it to the tragic crisis of unprecedented hunger and unemploymentâ€¦Therefore, I am for Socialism, disarmament and ultimately, for the abolishing of the State itselfâ€¦I seek the social ownership of property, the abolition of the propertied class and sole control of those who produce wealth. Communism is the goal.&#8221;

9. [The ACLU do not belive in the Second Amendment.][5]

> ACLU POLICY &#8220;The ACLU agrees with the Supreme Court&#8217;s long-standing interpretation of the Second Amendment [as set forth in the 1939 case, U.S. v. Miller] that the individual&#8217;s right to bear arms applies only to the preservation or efficiency of a well-regulated militia. Except for lawful police and military purposes, the possession of weapons by individuals is not constitutionally protected. Therefore, there is no constitutional impediment to the regulation of firearms.&#8221;[ACLU Policy #47][6]

#8. [Their outright hatred of the Boyscouts.][7] They are currently doing everything in their power to hurt this organization. They attacked their free speech right to exclude gays, and are threatening schools, and fighting in court to get their charters shut down. The oppose the military supporting them, and will sue the pants off any school that attempts to charter them. 

#7. The ACLU are pro-death. Not only is the ACLU Pro-abortion, [it&#8217;s the ACLU&#8217;s top priority.][8] It most definitely takes a backseat to free speech for the ACLU. As a matter of fact, the [ACLU has fought against the free speech rights of those that oppose it][9]. If its abortion or [euthanasia][10], as long as its pro-death you can count on the ACLU to support it. The only exception to the ACLU&#8217;s pro-death stance, is if it is a convicted criminal; in this case they are against death.

#6. [The ACLU advocate open borders.][11] Not only have the ACLU opposed the Minute Men, a group who are simply exercizing their freedom of speech, protesting and stepping up where the government is failing, but they have [helped illegals cross the border.][12]

#5. The ACLU is anti-Christian. The list is endless on this one. Under the guise of &#8220;seperation of Church and State&#8221;, the ACLU have made a name for theirself on being rabidly anti-Christian. This is one area where they are most hypocritical. [The oppose tax exemptions for all churches][13], but fight for them for Wiccans. They are against [Christianity in school][14], but oddly remain silent [as our children are taught to be Muslims.][15] Whether its [baby Jesus][16], [ten commandments][17], [or tiny crosses on county seals][18], the ACLU will be there to secularize America, and rewrite our history.

#4. [The ACLU Opposes National Security][19]. The ACLU have opposed almost every effort in the arena of national security. From the [bird flu][20] to [bag searches][21], the ACLU have been against it. No matter what kind of search someone tries to do to protect people, the ACLU have proved they are [against them across the board.][22] Its kind of ironic that [they don&#8217;t practice the principles they preach.][23]

> Take a walk into the NYCLU&#8217;s Manhattan headquarters &#8211; which it shares with other organizations &#8211; and you&#8217;ll find a sign warning visitors that all bags are subject to search.

#3. [The ACLU Defend the enemy.][24] They have a long history of this one. [They defended the P.L.O.][25] in 1985. They [defended Quadafi][26] in the 1980&#8217;s. And they continue today. They [have told Gitmo detainees they have the right to remain silent][27], as in not talking to interrogators. One issue that really disturbs me is their [refusal of funds from organizations such as the United Way that were concerned the money would be used to support terrorism.][28] 

> In October of 2004, the ACLU turned down $1.15 million in funding from two of it&#8217;s most generous and loyal contributors, the Ford and Rockefeller foundations, saying new anti-terrorism restrictions demanded by the institutions make it unable to accept their funds.
> 
> &#8220;The Ford Foundation now bars recipients of its funds from engaging in any activity that &#8220;promotes violence, terrorism, bigotry, or the destruction of any state.&#8221;
> 
> The Rockefeller Foundation&#8217;s provisions state that recipients of its funds may not &#8220;directly or indirectly engage in, promote, or support other organizations or individuals who engage in or promote terrorist activity.&#8221;

#2. The ACLU supports [child porn distribution][29] and [child molesters like NAMBLA][30].

> As legislative counsel for the ACLU in 1985, Barry Lynn told the U.S. Attorney General&#8217;s Commission on Pornography (of which Focus on the Family President Dr. James C. Dobson was a member) that child pornography was protected by the First Amendment. While production of child porn could be prevented by law, he argued, its distribution could not be.

There is no doubt the [The ACLU are perverting the Constitution.][31]

#1. [The ACLU fufills its agenda using my tax money.][32] What more can I say on this one? 

There are countless reasons the ACLU needs to be stopped. So don&#8217;t just stand by and complain, do something. Get involved. Here are some ways you can get involved to help us stop the ACLU.

Support and donate to organizations fighting them in Court. Here are the ones at the forefront.
