## What WordPress custom fields should have been {.subtitle}

I found [Advanced Custom Fields][1] (also known as **ACF**) about 6 months ago while working on a project for a client. They didn&#8217;t want to have to mess around with editing the Custom Fields that come native with WordPress, it just wouldn&#8217;t have worked as smoothly.

The client needed to require one image, one PDF, one year selection, and one category. The category consisted of two options, &#8220;Weekly&#8221; or &#8220;Daily&#8221;. If you&#8217;re wondering, it was a newspaper client who wanted to categorize their posts as being either a &#8220;weekly issue&#8221; or a &#8220;daily issue&#8221;. Makes sense for a newspaper!

Getting the native WordPress custom fields to [play along well with files can be tricky][2], and probably not worth the effort, especially with a plugin like Advanced Custom Fields around.

So, enter the hero of this post, [Advanced Custom Fields][1]. I was able to set everything up with Advanced Custom Fields within about 20 minutes, and that even counts the time that I took to make various theme templates pull data from Advanced Custom Fields. The actual setup of Advanced Custom Fields took about 2 minutes.

I&#8217;ve since started using Advanced Custom Fields here at longren.io, too. [Independent Publisher][3], the WordPress theme I&#8217;ve been using, likes to show one main category when you&#8217;re viewing a single post, even if it&#8217;s not the most relevant category. So instead of a post about WordPress having the **Git** category shown at the top, I can now specify which category I want to be shown. So, for a post like this, I would obviously choose **WordPress** as my primary category.

I&#8217;ve already added the necessary parts to my Independent Publisher child theme, and have sent a pull request to [Raam Dev][4] to get his thoughts. It&#8217;s a very easy thing to support in a theme, however, it requires that everyone using that theme use the same field name in ACF.

I named my field **primary_category**, since that&#8217;s exactly what it is.

After you&#8217;ve added your &#8220;Primary Category&#8221; custom field, you can then use the value of that field throughout your theme. I&#8217;ll have a short post later this week on exactly how you can display the primary category value in your theme. Or, if you want to know right now, you can [see this pull request at GitHub][6].

As you can tell, [Advanced Custom Fields][1] is a beast of a plugin. I also love that Advanced Custom Fields is totally free, which is kind of amazing to me. I&#8217;ve come across many paid plugins that are nowhere near as polished and user friendly as Advanced Custom Fields.

[Advanced Custom Fields][1] doesn&#8217;t skimp on the documentation, either. Their [documentation site][7] is extremely helpful, I never once ventured away from it while getting familiar with Advanced Custom Fields for the first time.

You can download Advanced Custom Fields [from the WordPress Plugin Directory][8], so you can also install it in just a few clicks, right from your WordPress Dashboard! Advanced Custom Fields is developed primarily by [Elliot Condon][9], and can [also be found on GitHub][10].

The great thing about this is that it can be applied to any theme, not just [Independent Publisher][3]. So, if you&#8217;re not using Independent Publisher, just setup Advanced Custom Fields as I described and make the necessary changes for your theme.

A follow-up post will have more details on using data from Advanced Custom Fields, no matter what theme you&#8217;re using.
