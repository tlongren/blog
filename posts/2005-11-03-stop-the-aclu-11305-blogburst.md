In recent days we have been bombarded with news concerning the Bush Administration and its troubles with the Valerie Plame idiocy. And as tempting as it is to talk about that and Rep. Tom Delay&#8217;s victories in Texas, this is a subject oriented blog and this is Stop The ACLU BlogBurst Thursday.

It seems from my email alerts that the Most Dangerous Organization in America is concerning themselves mainly with voter ID requirements in various states and prayers being said in local council meetings. Don&#8217;t these idiots have a life?

From the [ACLU][1]:

> ALBUQUERQUE &#8211;The American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico filed a lawsuit today asking a federal court to declare Albuquerque&#8217;s recently passed Voter ID Amendment &#8220;unconstitutional, illegal, null and void.&#8221;
> 
> The new law requires people who vote in person to present a &#8220;current valid identification card containing the voter&#8217;s name and photograph.&#8221; Among the acceptable forms of identification are a driver&#8217;s license, a credit card, and a voter identification card issued by the City Clerk. Absentee voters are exempt from any photo ID requirements.
> 
> &#8220;If you&#8217;re poor or homeless, there&#8217;s a good chance you don&#8217;t have any of the permissible forms of identification,&#8221; said ACLU Executive Director Peter Simonson. &#8220;Wealth shouldn&#8217;t determine your ability to participate in democracy. Americans shouldn&#8217;t have to jump through unnecessary hoops to exercise their constitutionally-guaranteed right to vote.&#8221; 

Why are people traveling around without identification in the first place. At minimum ID should be carried in the event of an accident. It is a no brainier to require an ID to vote. How else would the elections officials be able to tell if you are who you say you are?

Across this nation we hear stories of people registering their dogs and dead relatives. This is voter fraud. And the simplest solution to combat voter fraud is requiring ID to vote.

The ACLU&#8217;s contention that this is an effort to suppress the poor vote which is heavily Democratic is nothing more than a political temper tantrum. The ACLU would like voter registration to remain as is because it allows people to vote more than once.

In other news, the ACLU of Tennessee is asking the 6th District Court of Appeals to uphold a ruling by a lower court which barred &#8220;Choose Life&#8221; license plates. Excuse me&#8230; But didn&#8217;t a case like this in Ohio just get settled? And if I&#8217;m not mistaken, the Choose Life plates won out.

From the [ACLU][2]

> CINCINNATI &#8211; The American Civil Liberties Union today asked the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals to uphold a lower court ruling blocking an anti-abortion specialty license plate in Tennessee, saying that the plate discriminates against opposing viewpoints.
> 
> &#8220;When the state of Tennessee approved an anti-abortion license plate and failed to do the same for a pro-choice plate, it effectively cut off public discussion,&#8221;&#8221; said Julie Sternberg, Senior Staff Attorney with the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project, who argued the case today before the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. &#8220;The lower court made clear that the state cannot open up a forum for public debate on abortion without allowing both sides an equal opportunity to express their position. We are hopeful that the appeals court will do the same.&#8221;
> 
> The law in question makes a &#8220;Choose Life&#8221; license plate available to motorists for an annual fee of $35 over and above the basic costs of registering a car in the state. Fifty percent of all funds raised, after expenses, go to a private anti-choice organization called New Life Resources. The legislature twice rejected an amendment that would have authorized a &#8220;Pro Choice&#8221;&#8221; specialty plate.

This is the same old argument against the right of a state to govern themselves. The members of Politburo take every opportunity to trample on the states&#8217; 10th guarantees by getting a panel of black robed Kings by Committee to make decisions as to what is best for the citizens; taking away the power of guaranteed them through the system of representative government.

The people have representatives to their state governments to make decisions like these. And when necessary, the people themselves take a popular vote on issues. But God forbid if the people or their elected officials make a decision which differs from the ACLU&#8217;s agenda. Ooops, I&#8217;m sorry, we can&#8217;t mention God. But we can mention Satan, Allah, the Spirits of the 4 winds, or any other Deity just as long as it isn&#8217;t God or mentions the name Jesus.

Specialty license places are used to raise money for various charities. From protecting the wildlife of a state to private organizations, people select these plates to show their support of the cause. This is the vary argument made in the Ohio case.

Moving on we get to the Cobb County prayer case. The ACLU has their panties in a twist over a prayer being said using the words, &#8220;in the name of my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.&#8221; Oh no! A town dares to challenge the ACLU over religion! Savages&#8230; Don&#8217;t they know that rules of PC tolerance forbids the mention of the Judeo/Christian Deity?

Cobb County is fighting the ACLU suit by filing a 50 page brief. In the brief, the County makes a point of fact, &#8220;As a matter of historical fact, the exact prayers given in the first Congress explicitly referred to Jesus Christ.&#8221;

As we have seen in this past year if a historical context can be attached to a religious reference it is permissible. The US Supreme Court ruled in July that a memorial containing the 10 Commandments could remain in front of a court house citing its historical context.

So if it is permissible for the House of Representatives of the United States to refer to the Christian savior in its first session, what right has anyone to tell a local government that they cannot follow that tradition? None.

It seems to me that these idiots can be pursuing cases where real civil liberties are being violated. Wait, that is over with isn&#8217;t it. The government of the United States no longer discriminates against anyone regardless of race, creed, national origin, sex, sexual preference, or handicap. So they haven&#8217;t any real horse in a race. So they remain relevant by prosecuting legal actions against local governments. And in this way, they put forward their founder&#8217;s vision for America. &#8220;Communism is the goal.&#8221; &#8211; Roger Baldwin 1935.
