As you can tell I switched the theme for this site. This loads much quicker. I got rid of some graphics to help with that. I really enjoy the minimalistic style this theme brings.

A few items are still missing from this new theme. I&#8217;ll add them tonight after work hopefully.

My main reasons for using this theme are:  
1. Minimalistic  
2. Clean and easy to read  
3. Will afford me more opportunities to customize the site  
4. Quick loading

Oh, and the theme I&#8217;m using is [Oxymod][1]. I also updated my blogroll. Deleted old links, added a few new ones. If you want on there, just leave a comment in this post. I removed quite a few, not necessarily meaning to. If your blog is no longer there and you want it to be, leave a comment.

Oh, check out what [Basil has for lunch today][2]. 

<div class="wpulike wpulike-default " >
