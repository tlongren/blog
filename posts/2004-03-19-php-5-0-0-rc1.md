Since PHP 5.0.0 is now at release candidate 1, I decided to give it a try. So, this website is now running on PHP 5.0.0RC1. So far, all the code I&#8217;ve written seems to work still, which is very good.

<a href=http://zend.com/php5/>Zend.com has a page that has links to PHP 5 docs. There&#8217;s a list of backward incompatible changes:  
<a href=http://zend.com/manual/migration5.incompatible.php>http://zend.com/manual/migration5.incompatible.php</a>

Update:  
I was gonna mention, but forgot to, that DJ Pi&#8217;s Trance Empire Vol. 07 is due out soon. He&#8217;s waiting on some artwork to get finished up before it&#8217;s released.
