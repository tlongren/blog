That&#8217;s right, fear the orange you mis-guided fools. Some of you might know what I&#8217;m speaking of. It makes me laugh everytime &#8220;they&#8221; do it though. And Tom Ridge talking about it on TV is about the funniest thing I&#8217;ve ever seen. I think he uttered the words &#8220;9/11&#8221; between 15 and 20 times today. Let it go already&#8230;that&#8217;s all you got Tom, and you know it!
