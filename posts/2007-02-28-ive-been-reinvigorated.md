[Reinvigorate][1] is really nice. It&#8217;s a website statistics package, similar to [Google Anlaytics][2] and [Mint][3]. On the Reinvigorate home page, the service is described as &#8220;Measurement, performance, and regression analysis tools for evolving websites and blogs of all sizes&#8221;, sweet. Anyway, I signed up for the private beta a long time ago and finally received an invitation a few days ago.

Dougal Campbell has [blogged][4] about reinvigorate a [couple times][5], check his posts out for some more background information on Reinvigorate.

<a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.longren.org/images/reinvigorateDetailed-Full.jpg" rel="thumbnail" title="Reinvigorate - Detailed Visitor Activity"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.longren.org/images/reinvigorateDetailed-Thumb.jpg?resize=100%2C76" width="100" height="76" alt="Reinvigorated Detailed Activity" align="left" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Reinvigorate gives a really unique view of your website or blog, especially when it comes to tracking [individual users][6]. They also have a neat feature called &#8220;Name Tags&#8221;. Name Tags associate information on your website or blog (names, email addresses, etc) with the session id assigned by Reinvigorate. For example, this lets me track commenters based on the name they use when commenting. If someone comments, the name they used in the comment will show up in Reinvigorate. This makes it easy to see all the pages the commentor visited and how much time they spent on each page. Reinvigorate describes Name Tags as follows:

> Name Tags are an easy way to identify exactly who your visitors are.
> 
> It works by associating information your site manages (username, e-mail, account ID, etc..) with the session ID Reinvigorate uses to track visitors on your site/blog.
> 
> It&#8217;s extremely simple to setup, even if your site uses its own proprietary user account system. 1-2 extra lines of code and we take care of the rest.

<a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.longren.org/images/reinvigoratePlugin-Full.png" rel="thumbnail" title="Reinvigorate - Plugin for WordPress"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.longren.org/images/reinvigoratePlugin-Thumb.jpg?resize=100%2C79" width="100" height="79" alt="Reinvigorated - Plugin for WordPress" align="left" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Name Tags are extremely simple to make use of if you use [WordPress][7]. Reinvigorate has a plugin for WordPress that makes using Name Tags a breeze. The plugin also prevents you from having to manually add the tracking code to your blog. You can turn on Name Tags right from the plugin options page. Just activate the plugin, enter your tracking id, turn Name Tags on or off, and you&#8217;re set.

I&#8217;m really happy with Reinvigorate after using it for only two days. It&#8217;s exciting to know it&#8217;s still in beta, so hopefully they&#8217;ll continue to add features and more options. One thing I would really like is the ability to select a date range to view data for. Especially for the search terms, I want to see my top search terms over certain periods of time. Same goes for popular pages too.

If you haven&#8217;t already, go [sign up for the beta][1]. You may have to wait a while for an invitation, but it&#8217;s worth the wait. I can&#8217;t wait to see what the developers have planned for Reinvigorate in the future.
