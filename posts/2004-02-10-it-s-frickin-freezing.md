The blower motor on our furnace went out yesterday. Initially we thought it was just the pilot light that got blown out, but after re-lighting that, the furnace still didn&#8217;t work. The blower fan motor was really warm and the fan wasn&#8217;t turning at all, even when the motor was supposedly on.

I called a guy from Neighbors Heating-Cooling and he came out here around 8:30 pm and got a new motor installed. The bill came to about $400, I&#8217;m glad I don&#8217;t have to worry about that one.

Within 5 minutes of the furnace coming back on, I could feel the blood returning to my finger tips as my hands started to swell, it was a great feeling.
