I flipped on the TV when I woke up yesterday to watch the news on [KCCI][1] like I always do. I caught the very end of [a piece][2] about Google building two facilities in Iowa. I didn&#8217;t believe my ears at first, I just assumed they were looking at Iowa as an option for building.

I got into work and went to the KCCI website. Sure enough, right on the front page was a story titled &#8220;Some Not Surprised By Google&#8217;s Move&#8221;. It was the top story of the day at the time. Here&#8217;s some of [the article][2] from the KCCI website:

> DES MOINES, Iowa &#8212; It has been a well-kept secret until Tuesday.
> 
> Google Inc. is setting up shop in Iowa. The question is why.
> 
> The state&#8217;s reputation as a great place to live and work could have played a big role.
> 
> &#8221; I would like to begin with these four words: Google welcome to Iowa,&#8221; said Gov. Chet Culver in a news conference Tuesday in Council Bluffs.
> 
> The economic impact is predicted to be huge.
> 
> Google will invest $600 million in two new facilities, including a data center that is under construction in Council Bluffs.
> 
> The 1,100-acre site will house a data farm. The 200 news jobs are forecast to add up to $10 million a year to the state&#8217;s economy.

Google has a page dedicated to [the Council Bluffs data center][3] and there&#8217;s [also a nice FAQ][4].

Google is currently taking applications for employees in the Council Bluffs data center. Needless to say, my resume will be on its way to them shortly, [this position][5] really caught my eye. Too bad I don&#8217;t have a degree of any sort, I&#8217;ll probably be overlooked for that reason alone.
