My cable is supposed to be installed today between 8:00 am and 12:00 pm. I just got back to the apartment from work. I went in around 7:00 so I could get a few things done before I had to leave. Hopefully I&#8217;ll be able to get back there by noon or so.

It was really nice here over the weekend. It was in the upper 50&#8217;s Friday and Saturday. Rained a bit yesterday, and snowed about 3 inches lastnight. We&#8217;re supposed to get more snow tomorrow. It&#8217;s sorta sad to see all the snow go away, and then it&#8217;s basically back the next day.

I&#8217;ve been wanting to get a real domain name for a while now and leave [no-ip.com][1] behind. Yahoo! is selling domain names for $4.95/year. I just need to find a decent registrar that accepts paypal (not cc paypal). I&#8217;ve got a couple domain names in mind. Still not sure which one I&#8217;m gonna go with for sure. I guess you&#8217;ll know when you see this domain name change.

Also, I was sad to see the Eagles lose lastnight in the SuperBowl. They get so close every year but can never seem to come away with it.
