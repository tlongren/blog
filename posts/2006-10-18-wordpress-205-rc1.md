[WordPress][1] 2.0.5 RC1 (release candidate 1) is out. A number of changes have been made to 2.0.5 RC1 since we saw beta 1. There have been [quite a few fixes and enhancements][2] made in 2.0.5 so far, although [most of them are pretty minor][3]. 

I upgraded this blog to 2.0.5 RC 1 a few hours ago. I haven&#8217;t noticed any problems or anything acting strangely, so 2.0.5 RC1 seems pretty stable. Not really a surprise, I was running betas and all sorts of weird releases a year ago or so, and all of them were stable as could be. I&#8217;ve come to expect near perfect beta and RC releases from the WordPress team. They do an excellent job.

If you&#8217;re interested in running this, you can download the nightly releases by joining the [WP Testers mailing list][4]. You can also download 2.0.5 RC 1 [via subversion][5]. To grab the latest release candidate with subversion, issue this command:

<pre>svn co http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress/branches/2.0</pre>

After issuing that subversion command you will have the latest copy of WordPress 2.0.5, weather it&#8217;s 2.0.5 RC1 or even a newer release.
