You&#8217;ve undoubtedly heard by now that Rosa Parks passed away lastnight at the ripe old age of 92. I saw a little about it lastnight on FoxNews before heading to bed. Many people attribute the civil rights progress that was made since the 50&#8217;s and 60&#8217;s to her refusing to give up her bus seat for a white person. From [WaPo][1]:

> Rosa Parks, the dignified African American seamstress whose refusal to surrender a bus seat to a white man launched the modern civil rights movement and inspired generations of activists, died last night at her home in Detroit, the Wayne County medical examiner&#8217;s office said. She was 92.
> 
> No cause of death was reported immediately. She had dementia since 2002.

No doubt she made a huge contribution to the civil rights movement. Was she a pawn of the NAACP though? Probably. James Joyner of [Outside The Beltway][2] linked to a post in which [Richard Evans argues][3] that Rosa was indeed a pawn of the NAACP. It wouldn&#8217;t surprise me at all if the NAACP basically took her over for their own agenda. I don&#8217;t exactly see how any of that matters now. I mean, we already know how organizations like the NAACP function, would we expect anything less?

James also has good post [summarizing Rosa][4] and notes how todays civil rights activists pale in comparison to Rosa. He couldn&#8217;t be more right.

Others blogging include [Iowa Voice][5], [The Political Teen][6], [Stop the ACLU][7], [My Vast Right Wing Conspiracy][8], [Vodkapundit][9], and [La Shawn Barber][10].
