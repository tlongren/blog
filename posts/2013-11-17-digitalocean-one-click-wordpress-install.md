I&#8217;ve been using [DigitalOcean][1] a LOT lately. Disclaimer: That first link will give me referral credit if you do end up using DigitalOcean. I&#8217;ve used a small droplet from them for a while now to host a [non-exit Tor relay][2], it runs $5 a month. They frequently [give out][3] [promo codes][4] on [Twitter][5], too, sometimes [worth a couple months of free hosting][6].

I recently moved this site to a new 1GB DigitalOcean droplet, and [used their one-click WordPress install][7] to do it. Some things had changed when deploying new droplets since I had created my first droplet a few months ago. The most noticeable change was the addition of pre-built images of various types, including one for a WordPress installation, as you can see in the images associated with this post.

They&#8217;ve got one-click installs for WordPress, various environments including LAMP and Ruby on Rails, both available on various Linux distributions. They&#8217;ve even got one for [Ghost][8], the new blog system built with Node.js. I really like how they&#8217;ve implemented the whole thing, deploying a new droplet for a WordPress install seriously takes a few minutes, and that&#8217;s including SSHing into the new droplet and finishing up with WordPress install.

I&#8217;ve been really happy with DigitalOcean so far. Don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve experienced any downtime, at least none that me or various monitoring services have noticed, lol. Since you can get promo codes, and a short bit of free hosting, it can&#8217;t hurt to [try them out][1]. Their servers start at $5/month with 512MB RAM and 20GB SSD Disk, with 1TB of data transfer. Even without the promo codes, their prices are really attractive, at all levels.
