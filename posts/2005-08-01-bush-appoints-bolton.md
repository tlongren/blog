I hadn&#8217;t read this before heading over to [Clarity and Resolve][1] this afternoon. It seems, despite much opposition from the left, that President Bush [has appointed John Bolton][2] as U.N. ambassador. I love what Patrick at Clarity and Resolve [said about this][3]:

> You know what I like about Bolton, kuffar? I bet you do. I like that he doesn&#8217;t like the U.N. Time to wake up and smell the Kofi.

That man is funny. Kevin at Wizbang also seems to think [Kofi should be worried][4] by Bolton&#8217;s arrival. I hope Kevin and Patrick are right.

Bush appointed Bolton in a recess appointment. That means Bolton will be ambassador until a newly elected congress takes office in the summer of 2007. 

Captain Ed over at [Captains Quarters][5] adds that Senator Chris Dodd &#8220;tried a last-minute rhetorical block on Bolton&#8217;s appointment, warning the White House that a recess appointment would mean that Bolton does not have the &#8220;confidence of Congress&#8221; in his new position&#8221;. He&#8217;s also [got a link to other recess appointments][6] by recent presidents.

I hope Bolton at least attempts to stir up the U.N. They desperately need someone there to clean stuff up and expose those who profit from the U.N.&#8217;s actions. It&#8217;d be great if Bolton could do that, but I wouldn&#8217;t count on it.
