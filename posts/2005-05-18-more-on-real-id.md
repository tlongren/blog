This again coming from [The Jawa Report][1]. Turns out there may be a few loopholes in it&#8230;

> The REAL ID Act, advertised as preventing states from issuing driverâ€™s licenses to illegal aliens, is now the law of the land.
> 
> REAL ID has all the right enemies. The Treason Lobby has denounced it as preventing &#8220;many drivers&#8221; from obtaining licenses.
> 
> But this is the truth: the REAL ID Act still contains loopholes big enough to allow truckloads of illegal aliens to get valid temporary state driverâ€™s licenses.

You can [read the rest of it at VDare][2].
