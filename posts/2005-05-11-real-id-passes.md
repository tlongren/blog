Well, the senate passed the Iraq Supplemental Spending Bill 100-0. That bill is the one which contains Real ID. Here&#8217;s what a Slashdot reader said:

> The [U.S. Senate has passed][1] the $82 billion [Iraq Supplemental Spending Bill][2] (approved by the House last week), which includes the Real ID act driver&#8217;s license reform ([previously reported here][3].) The [National Governors Association][4] has indicated at the possibility of a lawsuit to challenge the constitutionality of the Real ID provisions, which would create national driver&#8217;s license standards, and a federal database of information from all 50 states.

Well shit, it passed. I&#8217;m not suprised as it was shadily slipped into a bill to help our troops. That&#8217;s real dirty senators. So much for democracy, something like this should have been debated in a public arena for all to voice their opinions on. I for one do NOT welcome our new spying overlords. This makes me want to leave the country even more. I do not wish to live in a police state anytime soon, looks like I may not have a choice. I think it&#8217;s totally killer that &#8220;we the people&#8221; have no say in major changes to our country and way of living.
