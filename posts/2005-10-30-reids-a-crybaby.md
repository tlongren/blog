Harry Reid&#8217;s feelings must have really gotten hurt. Could he be any more of a baby? I don&#8217;t feel I need an apology Harry. Bush didn&#8217;t do anything to me or anyone else, why should he apologize for the actions of others? True, he&#8217;s got control over who&#8217;s in what positions, but he has no control over their individual actions once they&#8217;re there.

An apology is fine. Should Bush apologize, I won&#8217;t hold it against him. Harry Reid thinks of Bush as a a god-like figure, otherwise he wouldn&#8217;t want an apology from Bush for actions of those under him.

From [WaPo][1]:

> Reid said Bush should pledge not to pardon I. Lewis &#8220;Scooter&#8221; Libby, Cheney&#8217;s chief of staff who was indicted Friday on five charges relating to statements he made to the FBI and a grand jury investigating the leak of the identity of CIA operative Valerie Plame.
> 
> He took aim at Rove, whose actions were probed by Special Counsel Patrick J. Fitzgerald. Rove is reportedly still under investigation.
> 
> &#8220;I think Karl Rove should step down,&#8221; Reid said about the White House deputy chief of staff. &#8220;Here is a man who the president said if he was involved, if anyone in the administration was involved, out they would go. Anybody who is involved in this, they&#8217;re gone.&#8221;

What a damn idiot. It&#8217;s a witch-hunt. Only the witch is specifically Karl Rove. Dems obviously aren&#8217;t satisfied with Libby being indicted, they don&#8217;t even acknowledge that Libby was the one that was indicted, not Rove. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;re perfectly happy Libby got indicted, it&#8217;s just that he wasn&#8217;t their most prized target.
