This is a pretty neat item in the Google Labs right now. It&#8217;s basically a personalized Google homepage. So now when I go to <http://www.google.com/ig>, see something like this. I had to re-arrange the items to fit.  
<img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.longren.org/images/personalGoogle.png?w=1100" alt="My Perosonal Google Homepage" data-recalc-dims="1" />  
Here&#8217;s some of what [Search Views][1] had to say about it:

> Search Engine Journal has [coverage][2] of the Google Personalized Homepage, the beta version of which was revealed at the Google Factory Tour today. The personalized homepage is scheduled to be listed in [Google Labs][3], but we&#8217;re not showing it just yet.
> 
> In addition to being a competitor for the personalized services of Jeeves, MSN, etc. the service is a way for Google to tie all of its subscription services into one offering, though no RSS aggregation yet (boooooo).

It&#8217;s nice to have all that right there. My gmail, weather, and news. Barry @ [Search Engine Roundtable][4] also points out this is being [discussed on many forums][5]. 

<div class="wpulike wpulike-default " >
  <div class="wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked">
    <button type="button"
					aria-label="Like Button"
					data-ulike-id="1887"
					data-ulike-nonce="f40bf614b1"
					data-ulike-type="likeThis"
					data-ulike-template="wpulike-default"
					data-ulike-display-likers="0"
					data-ulike-disable-pophover="0"
