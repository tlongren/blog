I upgraded to PHP 4.3.0RC4 lastnight. I also upgraded to MySQL 4.0.6-gamma. Everything appears to work like it should, so hopefully there aren&#8217;t any problems.

I also finished up my first round of work for <a href=http://www.icre8.com/>ICRE8</a>. Hopefully they&#8217;ll have some more work for me to do. I enjoy working for them very much.

Kristin gave me her old lava lamp. It&#8217;s pretty neat. I like staring at it&#8230;it sits pretty much right in front of me on my desk, so I look at it a lot. 

<div class="wpulike wpulike-default " >
