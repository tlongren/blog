[IT@Cork][1] is a networking organization for IT professionals. They have an upcoming Web 2.0 half-day conference, which prompted [O&#8217;Reilly][2] [to send a cease and desist letter][3]. O&#8217;Reilly is claiming they&#8217;ve applied for a trademark for the term &#8220;Web 2.0&#8221;, attempting to prevent IT@Cork from using &#8220;Web 2.0&#8221; for its conference.

How fucking stupid is that? O&#8217;Reilly is a company that tries to appeal to the open source community, trademarking a term that&#8217;s been in wide use on the internet for the last 2-3 years is gonna hurt their reputation. O&#8217;Reilly claims to have come up with the term &#8220;Web 2.0&#8221; in 2003 while at the O&#8217;Reilly and CMP [Web 2.0 Conference][4]. That&#8217;s just fine and dandy, but for O&#8217;Reilly to do something like this is pretty out of the ordinary for the company. I really don&#8217;t care one way or the other, as I&#8217;ve [mentioned my thoughts][5] on &#8220;Web 2.0&#8221; before. It&#8217;s a marketing ploy, probably developed by O&#8217;Reilly. So I say we let em have their silly &#8220;Web 2.0&#8221; trademark.

OK, so all that went down yesterday. Today, [IT@Cork received a fax][6] from O&#8217;Reilly basically asking them to sign a document saying they&#8217;ll no longer use &#8220;Web 2.0&#8221; at future events. The VP of Corporate Communications at O&#8217;Reilly, Sara Winge, [had a message posted][7] to the O&#8217;Reilly Radar blog about the &#8220;Web 2.0&#8221; trademark controversy. It&#8217;s really pretty lame.

Nice job O&#8217;Reilly, you&#8217;ve upset a lot of people, a number of whom have been loyal customers for years.
