This is too funny. Some lady is suing a Lowes store because she was hit by a &#8220;wild&#8221; bird in their outside garden area. Apparently, the bird caused quite a bit of damage. It&#8217;s not mentioned if she was attacked once by the bird or if the bird made repeated assults on her.

She claims the bird caused injuries to her head, brain, neck, muscles, bones, nerves, discs, ligaments, as well leading to the loss of neurological functions and cognitive skills. To cause all that, the bird must have weighed at least 40lbs or attacked her 300-400 times if it&#8217;s a normal sized bird. She can&#8217;t really expect to win this can she? What a fucking nut-job.
