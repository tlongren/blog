<a href="https://i0.wp.com/farm1.static.flickr.com/174/385707231_17353e58d0_o.png" title="Last Spam Karma 2 Shot" rel="thumbnail"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm1.static.flickr.com/174/385707231_17353e58d0_m.jpg?resize=240%2C93" width="240" height="93" alt="Done Using Spam Karma 2" align="left" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>[Spam Karma 2][1] has served my well over the last year or two. As you can see from the image, SK2 stopped 76,264 pieces of comment spam from being published. Before [Akismet][2] was around, Spam Karma 2 was the plugin most people went to for spam protection.

Since Spam Karma 2 hasn&#8217;t been showing any signs of life lately, I&#8217;ve decided to ditch it in favor of [Akismet][2]. I know for a fact Akismet is being actively developed. Also, I know for a fact that Akismet fully supports WordPress 2.1. I&#8217;m pretty sure SK2 isn&#8217;t fully WordPress 2.1 compatible. I&#8217;m not sure though, I say that because I thought I read of some WordPress 2.1 users having lots of problems with SK2. I could be way off though, I can&#8217;t find whatever it was I thought I was reading now.

Anyway, Akismet is now protecting this blog from comment spam. I&#8217;m not anticipating any problems, but who knows. If you have problems posting comments please get in touch with me via the [contact form][3].
