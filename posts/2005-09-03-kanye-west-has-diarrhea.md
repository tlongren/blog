Kanye West said some really stupid shit on NBC lastnight. The [video][1] (via [Riehl World View][2]) is quite funny. I feel bad for Mike Myers though, he didn&#8217;t look to happy with Kanye&#8217;s statements. Basically, Kanye feels that President Bush &#8220;doesn&#8217;t care about black people.&#8221; He goes on to basically say that the U.S. governments goal is to kill black people in areas effected by Katrina. A lot of what he says isn&#8217;t really intelligible, he&#8217;s got some serious shit just pouring out of his mouth.

Personally, I think Kanye West is a racist. I&#8217;ve listened to enough of his music to know that he&#8217;s got some serious issues with white people. He likes to think that the entire establishment is out to get him and blacks in general. He&#8217;s seriously paranoid.

Anyone with half a brain can figure out why there&#8217;s so many black people in the areas hit by Katrina. Especially in New Orleans. Just [look at the numbers][3]. In the 2000 census, 67.25% of the New Orleans population was black. Does the census include poor people? I doubt it, but I dunno. With those numbers, I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s pretty safe to say that a majority of the poor population in New Orleans is also black. Why&#8217;s that? It&#8217;s not because they&#8217;re black you fucking retards Kanye and Jesse Jackson. It&#8217;s simply due to the fact that more black people live there than any other race. It&#8217;s not hard to comprehend. I wonder if Kanye finished school cuz it&#8217;s really a pretty basic principle.

[Confederate Yankee][4] has a press release from the Red Cross in response to Kanye&#8217;s comments on NBC. [PunditGuy][5] feels for Mike Myers too, as everyone probably does. Dave at [Garfield Ridge][6] has various updates. In one of the updates he mentions Chris Tucker at the end. I thought that was Chris Tucker, video is pretty blurry though. Mad Dog Vinnie&#8217;s [comment][7] at [Six Meat Buffet][8] is hilarious. This reminded Tony of an old SNL skit involving Mike Myers. I can&#8217;t say I recall that skit, but he&#8217;s [got a transcript][9] from the SNL.

I&#8217;m sorta late on this one as I was probably sleeping when this was on NBC lastnight. It&#8217;s too good to resist posting though. And it seems that I&#8217;m one of the few people in the blogosphere who knows who Kanye West is. He&#8217;s a rapper, and he&#8217;s actually really good. I used to listen to him a lot when I had my subs and amp in my car, mostly cuz his songs had massive bass lines. Now I just look down on him though as another Jesse Jackson/Al Sharpton wannabe.
