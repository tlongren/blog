OK, that marine that shot the guy that was &#8220;faking he&#8217;s fucking dead&#8221; did nothing wrong. It&#8217;s a war. If I was in a war, and some mother fucker popped up on me, after pretending to be dead, I&#8217;d straight kill him.

I was against the whole &#8220;kill em all&#8221; attitude when this war started. But fuck it. Kill em all. Who the fuck cares? The world population is outrageous anyway. Around 6.5 billion people. Offing a billion shouldn&#8217;t be a problem. The dirty killing techniques I&#8217;ve heard about these insurgents using is real grimy. It&#8217;s a good thing I&#8217;m not over there yet.

Also, how can the government willingly call up soldiers that have already served their terms in the military? If I was one of these people, I&#8217;d give the finger to the government and move to Canada. I hope the Canadian authorities arrest Mr. Bush for his war crimes next time he goes there.
