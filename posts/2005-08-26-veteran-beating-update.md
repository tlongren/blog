Ace of Spades HQ [has an update][1] in the story where those three thugs beat the hell out of those war veterans.

Seems that Rob, over at Say Anything, [did a little investigation][2]. He remembered hearing about those street fights people would videotape and then sell. Turns out there&#8217;s a company that pays for the movies has a Seattle phone number.

And Rob&#8217;s readers have noted that there were two other video cameras being used at the scene. A total of 3 video cameras. Seems highly unlikely there&#8217;d be three video cameras watching a spur of the moment fight. Perhaps this was this companies new low budget production?

It&#8217;s probably nothing but you never know. It is odd that a company that pays for these street fights has a Seattle number. I just hope they find these guys soon.

I suggest you read what Rob [has been doing about this][2]. He&#8217;s got a ton of updates.
