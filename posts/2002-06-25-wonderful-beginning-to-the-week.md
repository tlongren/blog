My girlfriend&#8217;s grandfather isn&#8217;t doing so well. He&#8217;s been in the hospital for the last 3 weeks. We went up to Minnesota on Sunday, came home lastnight, and will be going back up there later on this afternoon.

Good news though, when I got home, I found a nice new digital video camera sitting on the kitchen table. This thing is really fun to play with. It takes 3.5mp single picture also. It&#8217;s really nice. It has USB hookups and can take a 32mb memory card.

As for site news, I changed &#8220;Boxen&#8221; to &#8220;Rigs&#8221; in the &#8220;Information&#8221; section. I also added a &#8220;Yours Truly&#8221; part to the &#8220;About Us&#8221; section. It has a bunch of crapola about me. 

<div class="wpulike wpulike-default " >
  <div class="wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked">
    <button type="button"
					aria-label="Like Button"
					data-ulike-id="1506"
					data-ulike-nonce="e4d004911c"
					data-ulike-type="likeThis"
