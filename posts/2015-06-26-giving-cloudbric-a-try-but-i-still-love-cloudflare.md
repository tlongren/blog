## Going to try Cloudbric here for a while to see how exactly it compares to Cloudflare

Longren.io will be unavailable for possibly up to 48 hours. As soon as I&#8217;ve published this post, I&#8217;ll be updating my nameservers to point to Cloudbric, almost feels like cheating on Cloudflare, they&#8217;ve been very good to me.

I&#8217;ve been using [Cloudflare][1] for quite a while, nearly since it became available to the public. I love them and all the services they provide, especially with a Pro (or Enterprise) account. Cloudflare costs money though (if you want certain added protections), and many smaller websites don&#8217;t use a lot of bandwidth and aren&#8217;t provided the protections they should receive with Cloudflare.

Cloudbric aims to solve that by providing all the features Cloudflare provides (from what I&#8217;ve been told at least) for free as long as your site doesn&#8217;t use more than 4GB of bandwidth per month. I only have a few Pro sites with Cloudflare (longren.io being one of them), but am trying to cut back on the number of online services I pay for monthly, so this makes sense on a financial level if nothing else.

I&#8217;d never heard of [Cloudbric][2] until they got in touch with me via direct message on [Twitter][3] and introduced me to their services. They appear to provide everything that Cloudflare&#8217;s Enterprise service provides, glad they saw one of my tweets praising Cloudflare and decided to get in touch.

Cloudbric has been around for a while (15 years or so I believe) and I talked to one of their reps quite a bit about how what they provide is better than Cloudflare (other than the usage based cost, of course).

Here&#8217;s what he said:

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <p>
    1. Unlike other website protection services including Cloudflare, Cloudbric provides full-coverage website protection. Even though Web Application Firewall (WAF) and DDoS Protection features are crucial for website protection, these options cost at least $200/month from Cloudflare. Cloudflare&#8217;s free plan does not protect web application layer 3, 4, and 7, which makes it pointless.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    2. Our usage-based plan, rather than options plan, allows even free users to enjoy the most comprehensive security service. There are no charges for extra add-ons or features for more security. Users can enjoy all the features for FREE up to 4GB of traffic monthly.
  </p>
</blockquote>

Here&#8217;s a handy table from the Cloudbric website showing a feature comparison with similar providers like [Cloudflare][1], [Sitelock][4], and [Incapsula][5].

Figured I&#8217;d try it out on this site as it gets the most traffic out of my personal sites, and if everything&#8217;s cool, I&#8217;ll eventually be moving all clients over to Cloudbric. Just wish they had a way to import existing DNS records, some of my domain names have at least 50 sub-domains.

Longren.io subscribers will get this post via email, but longren.io could be down for up to 48 hours while stuff updates. I&#8217;ll update this post or maybe write a new one after I&#8217;ve used Cloudbric for a few days. You should at least [check them out][2], especially if you&#8217;re using Cloudflare for a site that doesn&#8217;t get enough traffic to make it worth paying for.

I really don&#8217;t want to leave Cloudflare, but if Cloudbric stacks up, I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;ll have to.

**Update:** After updating nameservers for longren.io to Cloudbric, an SSL issue was found. I went back to Cloudflare immediately, and within about an hour Cloudbric&#8217;s engineering team had a solution worked out. It sounds like they&#8217;ll be rolling the fix out on Monday June 29. So until then, longren.io will be on Cloudflare. I&#8217;ll post info about the issue in detail after Cloudbric has officially announced it or made the fix active.
