If you&#8217;re reading this post, chances are you&#8217;ve landed here looking for my CyanogenDefy Mirror. I&#8217;ve stopped maintaining that mirror as I no longer use my Motorola Defy, that phone has been given to my daughter. I recently got a Nexus 4, so I&#8217;ve been running a [Nexus 4 Mirror][1] instead.

I recently [switched from Dreamhost to FlipHost][2], and in the transition I didn&#8217;t bother moving all the files that were on the CyanogenDefy Mirror. There was something like 20GB worth of ROM&#8217;s there, something I didn&#8217;t want to move if not absolutely necessary.

So, if you&#8217;re here looking for builds from Quarx2k or other stuff for your Motorola Defy, I&#8217;m sorry to disappoint you.
