## Great for signup forms or affiliate links

I don&#8217;t place the DigitalOcean affiliate link manually at the end of each post. That&#8217;s because it&#8217;s super easy to do with `add_filter('the_content')`.

### Add The Message, With or Without HTML

<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">function add_post_bottom_content($content){

    $html = '&lt;span class="post-footer-message"&gt;&lt;a href="http://oursponsor.com" target="_blank"&gt;Thanks to our sponsor for the generous donation!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;';

    if( !is_page( ) && isset($html) ) {

        return $content . $html;

    } else {

        return $content;

    }

}

add_filter('the_content', 'add_post_bottom_content');</pre>

To disable the content, just empty the `$html` variable . 

<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">$html='';</pre>

The anchor tag is wrapped in a `span` with a class of `post-footer-message`. You&#8217;ll want to style your message with that, rename the classes if you want, just stay consistent with the naming.

Some basic styling, with no underline on hover:

<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">span.do_link a:hover {
  font-style:none;
}</pre>

As long as you have some basic CSS knowledge, you&#8217;ll be able to apply all the styling you need. Just remember to add your CSS to your child theme&#8217;s `style.css` file, or load [up the custom CSS file][1].

The code in this post can go in your theme&#8217;s **functions.php** file or in your [WordPress functionality plugin][2].

<div class="wpulike wpulike-default " >
  <div class="wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked">
    <button type="button"
					aria-label="Like Button"
					data-ulike-id="5746"
					data-ulike-nonce="c7be0ebb96"
					data-ulike-type="likeThis"
					data-ulike-template="wpulike-default"
					data-ulike-display-likers="0"
					data-ulike-disable-pophover="0"
					class="wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_likethis_5746"></button><span class="count-box">3+</span>
