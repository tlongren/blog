I&#8217;ve upgraded from stable PHP-4.3.0 to unstable PHP-5.0.0-dev. So far, everything seems to work just fine. I don&#8217;t expect things will stay that forever. I just thought I&#8217;d give it a shot for a while. I&#8217;ll probably go back to 4.3.0 within the next couple of days.

I also got my new Olympus D-550 camera to work under linux. You can just mount it like any other USB mass storage device. It&#8217;s pretty sweet. I like being able to view my images under Linux.
