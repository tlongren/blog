This will be my last post before leaving for Colorado. Ashley and I are leaving at 8:00 AM tomorrow morning. Mom decided to let us take her car as Ashley and I don&#8217;t have any cars that we trust to make it to Colorado. I&#8217;m just glad I&#8217;m not gonna have to rent a car.

Tonight we&#8217;re going out for dinner for Amber&#8217;s birthday. Amber is Ashley&#8217;s older sister who&#8217;s not going to Colorado this year. She&#8217;s not going cuz she has to stay here @ work cuz Ashley will be gone.

Lots of stuff has gone wrong today at work. I&#8217;m not even gonna go into details, it just sucks. There wouldn&#8217;t be any problems if I wasn&#8217;t leaving for Colorado tomorrow. Just a few things that I really would have liked to get taken care of before leaving.

Ashley and I will be returning on Sunday, July 24th. Back just in time for work on the 25th. I won&#8217;t be watching this site while I&#8217;m gone. I expect to see a shit load of trackback and comment spam when I get back. Just ignore it if you see any as I&#8217;m not gonna do anything to stop it permanently before I leave. I&#8217;ll make a permanent fix when I get back.
