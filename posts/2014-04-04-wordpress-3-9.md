## The most beautiful WordPress yet {.subtitle}

I decided to install the latest WordPress 3.9 nightly this evening. Either something went funky on the update to beta3, or there were database changes between beta 3 and the latest nightly. I dunno. All I know is that the latest nightly (27857) appears to be working nicely.

Something I&#8217;ve been wanting for a long time is a better widget management experience, and WordPress 3.9 delivers nicely.

> Drag-drag-drag. Scroll-scroll-scroll. Widget management can be complicated. With the new design, weâ€™ve worked to streamline the widgets screen.
> 
> Have a large monitor? Multiple widget areas stack side-by-side to use the available space. Using a tablet? Just tap a widget to add it.

When clicking on a widget to add, you&#8217;re presented with a list of available sidebar areas to choose. Just select the area you want to add the selected widget to. Here&#8217;s a screenshot.  
<figure id="attachment_6252" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6252" style="width: 354px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">[<img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/longren.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/widget.png?resize=354%2C281" alt="Choose where to add the Recent Posts widget." width="354" height="281" class="size-full wp-image-6252" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.longren.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/widget.png?w=354&ssl=1 354w, https://i0.wp.com/www.longren.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/widget.png?resize=300%2C238&ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 354px) 100vw, 354px" data-recalc-dims="1" />][1]<figcaption id="caption-attachment-6252" class="wp-caption-text">Choose where to add the Recent Posts widget.</figcaption></figure>  
WordPress 3.9 now has an [official release date, April 16][2]. I haven&#8217;t used the WordPress 3.9 nightly for long, but so far, so good. And without the folks below (**and** lots of others), WordPress wouldn&#8217;t be what it is today.  
[<img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/longren.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/leaders1.png?resize=790%2C220" alt="leaders" width="790" height="220" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6257" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.longren.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/leaders1.png?w=790&ssl=1 790w, https://i2.wp.com/www.longren.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/leaders1.png?resize=300%2C83&ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 790px) 100vw, 790px" data-recalc-dims="1" />][3]  
Some changes that can be found in WordPress 3.9 beta 3:

>   * New features like live widget previews and the new theme installer are now more ready for prime time, so check â€˜em out.
>   * UI refinements&nbsp;when editing images and when working with media in the editor. Weâ€™ve also brought back some of the advanced display settings for images.
>   * If you want to test out audio and video&nbsp;playlists, the links will appear in the media manager once youâ€™ve&nbsp;uploaded an audio or video file.
>   * For theme developers, weâ€™ve added HTML5 caption support ([#26642][4]{.reopened.ticket}) to match the new gallery support ([#26697][5]{.closed.ticket}).
>   * The formatting function that turns straight quotes into smart quotes (among other things) underwent&nbsp;some changes to drastically speed it&nbsp;up, so let us know if you see anything weird.

You can [find WordPress 3.9 beta 3 for download here][2]. After installing it, you&#8217;ll be prompted to update to the latest nightly. Well, that may be because of a plugin I have installed, so if that doesn&#8217;t happen, don&#8217;t worry, all is good. `:)`
