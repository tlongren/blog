Take note of this graphic. Notice there&#8217;s been 3,775,826 queries processed by that MySQL server in a little more than 5 days. Nothing too impressive right? Right.  
[<img alt="Lots of Queries" title="Lots of Queries" style="float: left;" align="left" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.longren.org/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/236118558_1d1fd8b23e.jpg?w=1100" data-recalc-dims="1" />][1]

We know MySQL can handle many more queries than that in a much shorter period of time. What amazes me is how well MySQL performs on the server it&#8217;s running on. The box hosting that MySQL server is an old HP. It&#8217;s got 1 Pentium II 400mhz processor with 128Mb of RAM. And it serves data to anywhere between 10 and 14 seperate PC&#8217;s at any given point in time. In addition to that, this MySQL server also provides data to a web interface that is used by 50 or so people. The MySQL server pumps out about 500Mb worth of data every day.

MySQL never ceases to amaze me in what it can do on less than optimal hardware.
