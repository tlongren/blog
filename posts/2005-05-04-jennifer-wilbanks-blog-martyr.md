Saw this by way of [Search Views][1]:

> Hang her up by her white satin heels? Make her reimburse the bridesmaids for making them buy those [awful dresses][2]? There are quite a few creative punishments you could think of for Jennifer Wilbanks, the runaway bride who faked her own kidnapping to wiggle her way out of her &#8220;I Do&#8217;s&#8221;.
> 
> The very least of which is the online flogging she&#8217;s receiving on the Atlanta Journal Constitution &#8216;[Talk of the Town][3]&#8216; blog, where she&#8217;s being raked over the comment coals.

> Already 250+ reponses deep, users are chiming in with such gems as this one, reacting to Wilbanks supporters who claim that her actions should be excused because she was under severe stress:
> 
> &#8220;Stressful is not having the money to feed your children, not deciding what to feed your 600 wedding guests&#8230;give me a break.&#8221;

> As someone who&#8217;s sat next to many a bride-to-be in a cube environment, I have to agree. Hearing someone talk about centerpieces and catering choices as if they affected the fate of the Western world gets old&#8230;quick.

> The huge user response to this issue, and the way the AJC.com blog is leveraging it, is certainly a point scored for the newspaper biz in terms of pageviews and user stick.

That&#8217;s pretty funny. I love the fact that nobody is really feeling sorry for her or anything. She shouldn&#8217;t be felt sorry for. I sure do hope her feelings aren&#8217;t hurt easily&#8230;
