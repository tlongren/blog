Now that [WordPress Multisite Administration][1] has been published, I&#8217;ve got some free copies in e-book form to give away. I&#8217;ll also be giving away some hard copies of the book, but that won&#8217;t be until a little bit later on.

So, if you&#8217;d like to win a free WordPress Multisite Administration e-book, just leave a comment here. The first 5 people to leave a comment will receive the free e-book. Make sure to leave your real name and actual email address. If I try to email you and it&#8217;s an invalid address, you&#8217;re disqualified and I&#8217;ll just move to the next person.

If you think you&#8217;ve got friends who may be interested, please, forward them here!

The cover of the book is below.
