I&#8217;ve released version 1.2 of the Thumbnail Viewer plugin for WordPress (actually released like 2 weeks ago, just now announcing). Not many changes were made in 1.2 except the fixed paths to the css and javascript files. The incorrect paths totally prevented the 1.1 from working for people who downloaded from the [WordPress Plugin Directory][1].

<p class="download">
  <a href="http://www.longren.org/wordpress/thumbnail-viewer/">Go Download Thumbnail Viewer Plugin 1.2</a>
</p>

Shortly after the [release of 1.1][2], I started [hosting thumbnail viewer][3] at the WordPress.org Plugin Directory. Hosting there gives me access to a [Subversion][4] repository, which I had never used before. Hosting at the WordPress Plugin Directory gives the plugin greater exposure and provides me with a central place to store all the code.  
<!--adsense-->

  
Version 1.2 was prompted when I started getting a bunch of people contacting me [saying the plugin was not working][5]. I got right down to it and realized the plugin was looking in the wrong directory for thumbnailviewer.css and thumbnailviewer.js. I renamed some directories before moving the project to the WordPress Plugin Directory and forgot to update the directory names in the PHP code.

So, version 1.2 was basically just a fix for the incorrect directory names. Until I can get a dedicated page setup here for thumbnail viewer, please see [the announcement post for version 1.1][2] for installation directions and examples. There&#8217;s also some pretty helpful comments in there.

<p class="download">
  <a href="http://www.longren.org/wordpress/thumbnail-viewer/">Go Download Thumbnail Viewer Plugin 1.2</a>
</p>

If you&#8217;re still running version 1.1, there&#8217;s nothing your missing in 1.2. However, the directory format in 1.2 is how it&#8217;s gonna be from now on, so you might as well upgrade. You can [download from the WordPress Plugin Directory][3]. The latest, most up-to-date version will always be on that page.

**UPDATE:** Finally!!! I&#8217;ve taken the time to create an [official page for my Thumbnail Viewer plugin][6]. Please try to keep all the support related questions centered [on that page][6]. The [announcement post for version 1.1][2] still has some pretty helpful comments though, I may decide to move them to the new page at some point.
