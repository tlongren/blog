It&#8217;s been a long time coming. Bush has taken heat from the left for far too long, without fighting back much. They constantly engage Bush, citing he mislead the American public with his reasons for going to war. I may be mistaken, but didn&#8217;t a pretty large number of Democrats vote for going to war?

Bush gave a [killer speech today][1], slamming Democrats for rewriting the history of how the war in Iraq began.

> While it&#8217;s perfectly legitimate to criticize my decision or the conduct of the war, it is deeply irresponsible to rewrite the history of how that war began. (Applause.) Some Democrats and anti-war critics are now claiming we manipulated the intelligence and misled the American people about why we went to war. These critics are fully aware that a bipartisan Senate investigation found no evidence of political pressure to change the intelligence community&#8217;s judgments related to Iraq&#8217;s weapons programs.
> 
> They also know that intelligence agencies from around the world agreed with our assessment of Saddam Hussein. They know the United Nations passed more than a dozen resolutions citing his development and possession of weapons of mass destruction. And many of these critics supported my opponent during the last election, who explained his position to support the resolution in the Congress this way: &#8220;When I vote to give the President of the United States the authority to use force, if necessary, to disarm Saddam Hussein, it is because I believe that a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his hands is a threat, and a grave threat, to our security.&#8221; That&#8217;s why more than a hundred Democrats in the House and the Senate &#8212; who had access to the same intelligence &#8212; voted to support removing Saddam Hussein from power. (Applause.) 

I doubt this will really improve the situation for Bush. Democrats will continue lying, because well, that&#8217;s what they do. They&#8217;re [already denying][2] they&#8217;ve tried rewriting history. Lets hope Bush will keep it up and not allow the dems to continue berating him at every chance they get. What better time to initially bite back than Veterans Day?
