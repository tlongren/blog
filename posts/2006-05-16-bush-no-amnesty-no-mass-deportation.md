I was impressed with [President Bush&#8217;s speech][1] lastnight. He did&#8217;t get out of it though without looking like a jackass, thanks to CNN. CNN cut to his rehersal speech for some reason, Bush was in mid-sentence then stopped to look over at an advisor or something before CNN left the video feed. [Expose The Left][2] has video of the error made by CNN.

Anyway, Bush made some great points in his speech lastnight. I watched most of it, although I missed the first 5 minutes or so. He&#8217;s basically attempting to make it nearly impossible for businesses to hire illegals. Along with that, a beefed up border patrol force will add security to the mexican-american border.

The National Guard has 6000 troops en-route to the border. There was footage on the local news lastnight of illegals getting all upset about National Guard troops being deployed. They claim we&#8217;re militarizing the mexican border. Sorry guys, but that&#8217;s not the case. The National Guard is there to provide support to border patrol. Bush specifically said lastnight that the National Guard wouldn&#8217;t play a role in directly enforcing laws. Any laws being enforced will still be done so by the border patrol, not the Guard.

Bush&#8217;s plan is pretty viable, from what I can tell. There&#8217;s no way we can deport 11 million illegals, it&#8217;s just not a possibility, although I wish it were. Those who are currently working illegally in the United States will have to go through all the legal channels before they&#8217;re &#8220;legal&#8221; to work. How many of them will do so? Not many probably. [Richard at Hyscience][3] doesn&#8217;t think Bush&#8217;s plan is so great, it&#8217;s too little too late for him.

None of this will work without participation from the entire business community. And the business community needs help from the government. Document fraud is everywhere. There&#8217;s currently no way for a company to prove that the documents given to them haven&#8217;t been forged. This is where the bio-metric cards Bush mentioned lastnight come into play. A fingerprint can&#8217;t be forged, not easily anyway.

I&#8217;m thankful we&#8217;re where we currently are on this immigration debate. I, for one, had doubts we would even reach this point. It&#8217;s clear drastic changes need to be made to our immigration policies. If not that, then we need to at least start policing our border with Mexico. I think we&#8217;re on the right path though, Bush&#8217;s plan is achievable and provides the means to enforce what illegals do once inside the country. Let&#8217;s face it, there&#8217;s always going to be a steady supply of illegals flowing from Mexico to the U.S. Hopefully this won&#8217;t open up an even more deadly black market in which illegals are traded back and forth&#8230;
