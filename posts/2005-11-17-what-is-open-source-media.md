[Open Source Media][1] is a blog advertising project whose name has been the subject of debate lately. Basically, seven people who do radio shows 4 times a week also use the name &#8220;Open Source Media.&#8221; The radio guys make extensive use of [bloggers as their &#8220;in-house&#8221; experts][2]:

> A joint production of Open Source Media Inc. and the University of Massachusetts-Lowell, Open Source is presented by WGBH Radio Boston and distributed by Public Radio International (PRI).

> What this means is that we are seven people in a rented office with, incidentally, a rather bold mouse who does not yet have a name. We make a radio show four times a week that uses bloggers as local and topical experts; this show is distributed to public radio stations by Public Radio International, and to truckers and early adopters by XM satellite radio.

Now, the blog ad project formerly called [Pajamas Media][3] is using the name &#8220;Open Source Media.&#8221; The [blog ad project][1] has a note on their website stating that the radio guys are going to allow the new OSM use of the opensourcemedia.net domain. Using &#8220;Open Source Media&#8221; as a company name seems like a stupid idea, it&#8217;s too general. It&#8217;d be like &#8220;FoxNews&#8221; changing it&#8217;s name to &#8220;TheNews.&#8221; When I hear &#8220;open source media&#8221;, I think of news providers who are more local and not so mainstream. But, whatever. To each their own. Oh, and I&#8217;ve made quite a few changes to this post. I think my original wording was causing some confusion. No, there was absolutely NO confusion on this end. ðŸ™‚

Oh, and I should note, [Allah was MIA][4] at the Open Source Media launch party.
