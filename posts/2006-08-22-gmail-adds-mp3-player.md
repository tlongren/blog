Google has apparently [added an MP3 playing feature to Gmail][1]. So, if someone emails you an mp3 as an attachment, the little google player will come up to allow you to play the sound right from Gmail. Very neat.

You can also [embed this player in your website][2] so your visitors can listen to an audio clip right from any page. The embedded player at Gmail calls this URL to play the attached MP3:  
<small>http://mail.google.com/mail/html/audio.swf?audioUrl=MP3_URL</small>

**UPDATE:** [iSpider goes into more detail][3] on how to embed the player in a website.
