For some reason, WordPress will send a `200` [HTTP response status code][1], or `OK`, when a login attempt has failed. Why not send a `403` status code, which is designed specifically to say _you can&#8217;t be here_, or `forbidden`, actually. There&#8217;s even a better alternative to `403`, but stay with me.

I came about this bit of information while reading [this post by Konstantin Kovshenin][2]. And was able to confirm it myself by logging into this site incorrectly, as you can see in the featured image above. **wp-login.php** is returned as `200 OK` and is circled in red.

So, as [Konstantin][3] suggested, we can use this code to send a proper `403 Forbidden` status code on a failed login attempt:

<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="php" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">&lt;?php
function my_login_failed_403() {
    status_header( 403 );
}
add_action( 'wp_login_failed', 'my_login_failed_403' )
?></pre>

But why send a `403`, which is `Forbidden`? It&#8217;s not truly a forbidden page, as people have a legit reason to be there, even if they can&#8217;t remember their password.

So, sending `401 Unauthorized` as the HTTP response status code may be even better.

<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="php" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">&lt;?php
function my_login_failed_401() {
    status_header( 401 );
}
add_action( 'wp_login_failed', 'my_login_failed_401' );
?></pre>

So, you can use either of those, the **first chunk** to send a `403 Forbidden` response, and the **second** for sending a `401 Unauthorized` response code.

<div id="polls-21" class="wp-polls">
</div>

<div id="polls-21-loading" class="wp-polls-loading">
  <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.longren.io/wp-content/plugins/wp-polls/images/loading.gif?resize=16%2C16&#038;ssl=1" width="16" height="16" alt="Loading ..." title="Loading ..." class="wp-polls-image" data-recalc-dims="1" />&nbsp;Loading ...
</div>

Either could go in the **functions.php** file for your theme, or more likely, in [your WordPress functionality plugin][4].

You can find a good [list of HTTP response codes at the Mozilla Developer Network site][1].

<div class="wpulike wpulike-default " >
  <div class="wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked">
    <button type="button"
					aria-label="Like Button"
					data-ulike-id="6098"
					data-ulike-nonce="c9adb65b73"
					data-ulike-type="likeThis"
					data-ulike-template="wpulike-default"
					data-ulike-display-likers="0"
					data-ulike-disable-pophover="0"
					class="wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_likethis_6098"></button><span class="count-box"></span>
  </div>
