We&#8217;re no longer located at longren.d2g.com. The DNS2Go service decided they needed to start charging money for their service. I don&#8217;t want to pay any money, so I moved to another free service called <a href=http://no-ip.org>No-IP</a>.

So, out new domain name is:  
<a href=http://longren.no-ip.org/>http://longren.no-ip.org</a>

I picked No-IP because they have a pretty nice linux client. It works well on the router, so it was really easy to set up. It took about 5 minutes to do.
