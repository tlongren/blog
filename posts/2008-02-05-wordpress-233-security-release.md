[WordPress][1] version 2.3.3 has [been released][2]. This release, like [the previous one][3], addresses an urgent security vulnerability that was found in the WordPress XML-RPC implementation. The flaw could allow any valid user on your blog to edit posts made by other users on your blog.  
<!--adsense-->

  
WordPress 2.3.3 also fixes some other [minor bugs][4]. If you don&#8217;t care about those minor bug fixes and just want to patch your blog against the XML-RPC vulnerability, you can download a fixed copy of [xmlrpc.php][5] and copy it to your WordPress installation directory, replacing the existing xmlrpc.php file.

You&#8217;re probably better off just [downloading WordPress 2.3.3][6] and doing the full upgrade.
