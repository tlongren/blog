[News Alloy][1] and [Feedlounge][2] are both AJAX based feed readers. News Alloy is free, Feedlounge is $5/month. I purchased a year subscription to Feedlounge about a month ago.

Now, I&#8217;ve tried using Feedlounge a bunch. Sometimes it works fine, other times it won&#8217;t work at all. A couple weeks back, I was unable to even login to my Feedlounge account. Feedlounge recently [made a new release][3], a release containing the most significant changes since their initial public release. That release was supposed to improve speed, I witnessed the exact opposite, a drastic slowdown. The Feedlounge team [made a few improvements][4] to performance. I still find it to be much slower than News Alloy.

Now, I&#8217;ve got no complaints with News Alloy at all. It&#8217;s free, it&#8217;s quick, and it&#8217;s pretty. It&#8217;s extremely easy to use, I much prefer the News Alloy UI to that of Feedlounge. News Alloy is so much more responsive too. I love the way it handles groups and categories for feeds. Feedlounge uses tags for group and category names, it was somewhat difficult to keep my feeds organized. For example, I would add a new feed and tag it &#8220;Politics&#8221;. Instead of showing up under the Politics tag it wouldn&#8217;t show up with any tag.  
<!--adsense#ypn-->

  
If you&#8217;ve used Gmail, you should feel right at home with News Alloy. It&#8217;s got some UI similiarities to Gmail that make it so much more usable. I also really enjoy the floating sidebar in News Alloy. It sports [some neat plugins][5] too.

In the [most recent post][6] at the News Alloy blog, a &#8220;no ads&#8221; feature is mentioned. I have yet to see any ads on News Alloy. Supposedly advertisements are displayed for those who haven&#8217;t donated to the project. They&#8217;re also coming out with a mobile version of News Alloy in March.

I&#8217;ve found my new full-time feed reader, News Alloy. Feedlounge looks nice but just doesn&#8217;t have the functionality I need. I won&#8217;t be renewing my subscription next year. Oh, News Alloy is still in beta and I think they&#8217;ve got a huge head-start on Feedlounge already.
