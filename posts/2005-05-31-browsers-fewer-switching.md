Fewer people than expected are actually switching to using something other than Internet Explorer for web browsing. I kept hearing all over the place that Firefox usage would grow to overtake IE. This may still happen, but it&#8217;s a long ways off from what I&#8217;ve experienced.

This site shows 62% of you are using IE and about 21% are using Firefox. And 59% are running Windows XP, while only 3.4% run Linux. Windows 2000 is second highest at 13.6%.

I suppose the number of IE users isn&#8217;t suprising looking at the number of Windows users. About 80% of the people who visit here run some form of Windows. Om Malik&#8217;s Broadband Blog [elaborates on this topic][1] a little bit more.

I wish I&#8217;d see more Firefox users here. I use it as my default browser on Windows and Linux. I can&#8217;t believe how much better than IE it is, but some people refuse to switch.

I&#8217;ve tried getting people at work to start using FireFox. They&#8217;ll use it until I leave the room and then they&#8217;re right back with IE. Maybe they just forget how to open FireFox. I mean, I only put an icon on their desktops&#8230;
