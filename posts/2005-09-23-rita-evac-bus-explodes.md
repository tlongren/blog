Via [Sister Toldjah][1]. 

> DALLAS &#8212; As many as 20 nursing home patients were killed early Friday when a busload of elderly Hurricane Rita evacuees from Houston caught fire then was rocked by a series of explosions on gridlocked Interstate 45, a Dallas County Sheriff&#8217;s spokesman said.
> 
> The bus loaded with 43 passengers was engulfed with flames, causing a 17-mile backup on a freeway that was already heavily congested with evacuees from the Gulf Coast.
> 
> &#8220;Deputies were unable to get everyone off the bus,&#8221; spokesman Don Peritz said. &#8220;We believe it&#8217;s gonna be closer to 20 fatalities.&#8221;
> 
> A Dallas County Medical Examiner told KXAS-TV that they are expecting as many as 24 fatalities.

That&#8217;s really, really sucky. I feel for their relatives. They probably weren&#8217;t expecting their relatives to die on a bus while being evacuated. It&#8217;s sort of ironic in a kinda sick way. heh. [The local NBC affiliate in Dallas][2] has a slideshow of the remains of the bus, they&#8217;ll most likely have updates as they&#8217;re available also. Dr. Steven Taylor at [PoliBlog][3] has the sad news too.
