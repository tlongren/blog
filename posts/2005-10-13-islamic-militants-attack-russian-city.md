Chechen gunmen attacked various government buildings including a school in the Russian city of Nalchik. President Putin has sealed the city off and given [shoot-to-kill orders][1] for anyone who they deem to be a threat. Here&#8217;s a bit from the [BBC][2]:

> Militants have staged mass raids on government and police buildings in a provincial capital in Russia, leaving dozens dead and many more injured.
> 
> Authorities say that 61 rebels have been killed, but 12 police and 12 civilians also died in the assault on Nalchik in Kabardino-Balkaria province.
> 
> Officials say militants are holding hostages at a police station in the city, which has been sealed off.
> 
> Militants from nearby Chechnya are believed to be behind the attacks.
> 
> A pro-rebel website said a group known as the Caucasus Front had claimed the attack.
> 
> The raid is the latest in a series of disturbances that have been destabilising Russia&#8217;s North Caucasus for more than a year. 

Doesn&#8217;t sound like a good situation at all. The good thing: 59 of the terrorists were killed and 17 were arrested, as of this writing anyway. Along with that, 12 police and 12 civilians have supposedly been killed, with 116 civilians being admitted to the hospital.
