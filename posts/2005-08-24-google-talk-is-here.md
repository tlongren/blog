[Google Talk][1] was announced lastnight. It&#8217;s still in beta and requires a gmail username and password to use. [IfElse][2] has a pretty decent summary of what Google Talk is exactly:

> *They&#8217;re using Jabber, an open protocol rather than their own proprietary system.  
> *They allow and support the use of other IM clients rather than  
> deliberately blocking other software as Yahoo, AIM and MSN have done.  
> *It works off your GMail account which doesn&#8217;t expire like hotmail and AOL accounts  
> *Builtin GMail notifier  
> *Free with no ads

[Mark Evans][3] discusses what this means for Skype. Seems like this will bump Skype&#8217;s numbers up a ways.

[Smash&#8217;s World][4] has a good how-to for getting Google Talk working with [Gaim][5]. And [Development on a Shoestring][6] was talking about this before the official announcment was even made.

[Search Engine Roundtable][7] also has some good notes about Google Talk while [John Battelle&#8217;s Search Blog][8] has a bunch of information. He&#8217;s got various reviews from various websites.

Below is a screenshot I just took.
