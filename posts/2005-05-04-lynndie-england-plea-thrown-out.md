Whoa! I just saw this on [Blogs of War][1]:

> FORT HOOD, Texas &#8211; A military judge Wednesday threw out Pfc. Lynndie England&#8217;s guilty plea to abusing Iraqi detainees at Abu Ghraib prison, saying he was not convinced the Army reservist who appeared in some of the most notorious photos in the scandal knew her actions were wrong at the time.
> 
> The mistrial marks a stunning turn in the case and sends it back to square one.
> 
> The case will be reviewed again by Fort Hood&#8217;s commander, Lt. Gen. Thomas Metz, who will decide what charges, if any, England should face. If she is charged, the case would go back to a military equivalent of a grand jury hearing, an Article 32 proceeding, prosecution spokesman Capt. Cullen Sheppard said.
> 
> The military judge, Col. James Pohl, entered a plea of not guilty for England on a charge of conspiring with Pvt. Charles Graner Jr. to maltreat detainees at the Baghdad-area prison and a related charge.
