HTML5Press 2.2 is available for download. You can grab it from [the HTML5Press page][1]. A [detailed list of changes][2] can be found at [Github][3].

Probably the most notable change in 2.2 is the addition of a &#8220;follow me&#8221; button to the Twitter widget, which you can see in the featured image attached to this post. It&#8217;s enabled by default, but can be turned off from the widget options.

Hashtags in the Twitter widget are now clickable, just like links and @names. I [committed this change][4] to the original [Simple Twitter Widget][5], created by [Matthias Siegel][6].

I also fixed an issue where small fonts were being applied to any label element, even when label wasn&#8217;t being used in a form. This made the title for the new &#8220;subscribe widget&#8221; from JetPack 1.2 be really small. So those of you using that widget should see an improvement.

Other notable changes:

  * [Field for Custom CSS][7] on HTML5Press options page
  * [More accurate fuzzy timestamps][8]
  * More accurate fuzzy timestamps [in comments][9]
  * [Use get\_template\_directory_uri()][10] instead of get\_stylesheet\_directory_url()
  * [Allow use of &#8220;All Categories&#8221;][11] for the featured post slider.

You can see all the [changes at Github][2]. You can download version 2.2 from the [HTML5Press page][1].

Report any issues in the comments [on the HTML5Press page][1] or [open up an issue at Github][12].
