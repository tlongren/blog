I think the title pretty much sums up this post. [This guy needs to stop taking himself so seriously][1], along with a few million other liberal hippies.

> Here are some quotes from a pro-abortion person, Miss Caroline Weber, who wrote an article at The Onion online magazine.
> 
> [The Onion Article][2]
> 
> When referring to the killing of her child she said:

> &#8220;I am totally psyched for this abortion!&#8221;
> 
> &#8220;Those pro-life activists made it pretty clear that, unlike me, they actually think abortion is bad and to be avoided. Are they nuts? Abortion is the best!&#8221;
> 
> &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t until now that I was lucky enough to be pregnant with a child I had no means to support.&#8221;
> 
> &#8220;I just know it&#8217;s going to be the best non-anesthetized invasive uterine surgery ever!&#8221;

[The Onion][3] is a well known satire website. They even have a syndicated radio show that airs across the nation on various FM stations.

<!--adsense-->

  
The Onion article this guy is upset about is dripping from every pore with sarcasm. You gotta be seriously out of touch with reality to take something like that seriously. Out of touch is probably easy for this guy, he&#8217;s pro-life after all.

[Jay Tea at Wizbang][4] got a good kick outta this too.
