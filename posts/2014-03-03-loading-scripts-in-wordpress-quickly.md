Here&#8217;s how I load scripts and styles in WordPress themes, in functions.php.

<pre class="lang:php decode:true " >function load_scripts() {
    // load styles
    wp_enqueue_style( 'custom-css-1', get_stylesheet_directory_uri() . '/css/custom-css-1.css' );
    wp_enqueue_style( 'my-secret-script-css', get_stylesheet_directory_uri() . '/css/my-secret-script.css' );


    // load javascript
    wp_enqueue_script( 'my-secret-script', get_stylesheet_directory_uri() . '/js/my-secret-script.js' );

}
add_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', 'load_scripts' );</pre>

The above code would load up two css files, `custom-css-1.css` and `my-secret-script.css`. It would also load one JavaScript file, `my-secret-javascript.js`.

[This post by [Brian Krogsgard][1] at [WPCandy][2] describes the proper way][3] of loading scripts, using `wp_register_script`, as it takes dependencies into consideration and allows loading of scripts by their defined name. However, I think the `wp_register_script` methodology is lengthier and a bit more difficult to read, mostly due to the dependency stuff.

However, _you do need to take dependencies into consideration_ if you&#8217;re using a JavaScript library, like [jQuery][4].

`wp_register_style` should also be used to load styles with dependencies. This [article at Tuts+ has a very good description and examples][5] on loading CSS stylesheets using `wp_register_style` and `wp_enqueue_style`.

You should also be aware of the differences when authoring themes and plugins, which Brian also explains in [his post on WPCandy][3]. That mostly involves one WordPress function out for another.

Let me know if you run into any issues, comments are open!
