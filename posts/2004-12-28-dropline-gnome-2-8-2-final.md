Yes, the final release of [Dropline Gnome 2.8.2][1] is finally here. This is the first community release of DLG. Previous releases were mostly due to the work of Todd. Now, there&#8217;s a number of DLG community members working together to bring us a nice, pretty desktop for our Slackware boxes.

I&#8217;m very happy with this new release of Dropline Gnome. I haven&#8217;t had any issues with it as of yet. I wanna go home and use it, but I can&#8217;t. I at least with I could run Linux and Dropline Gnome on my pc here @ work.

Here&#8217;s the official announcement in the DLG Forums:
