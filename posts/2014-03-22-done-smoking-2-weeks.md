## Approaching 2 weeks without a cigarette {.subtitle}

12 days and 19 hours without a smoke, to be more precise. I feel better than I have in a long time, my persistent smokers cough is gone, and I have noticed a definite increase in stamina in everything I do.

I still haven&#8217;t attempted going to a lower dose nicotine patch. There&#8217;s been a few mornings where I&#8217;ve forgotten to put a new patch on. On all of those occasions, I didn&#8217;t feel like I needed a cigarette, or nicotine. I just happened to see my box of patches, and it&#8217;s reminded me to put a new one on.

So, I&#8217;m thinking a lot of the nicotine dependency stuff is likely a mental crutch of some sort, I dunno, I&#8217;m not a psychologist.

I&#8217;ve actually surprised myself, too. When I stopped smoking, I didn&#8217;t really believe that it was something I could do and stick with.  
The last 10+ years that I&#8217;ve been a smoker, I&#8217;ve done a lot to convince myself that quitting would be a terrible experience. It hasn&#8217;t been terrible, at all. Still, I&#8217;d love to have a cigarette. `:)`

This will probably be my last post on this topic for a while, at least until I&#8217;m approaching 1 month without a cigarette.
