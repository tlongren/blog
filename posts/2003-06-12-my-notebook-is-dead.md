Yesterday for work, we went to migrate a business from Windows NT to Windows 2000. I took my Sony Vaio PCG-GRX500 with me, it came in very useful. We got done around 3:00 am, and when I got home, my notebook wouldn&#8217;t turn on. The power light comes on, but it never even reaches the BIOS screen. Something is really screwed up with it.

I submitted a support request with Sony. Hopefully they&#8217;ll have something for me in the morning. I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;ll do if they can&#8217;t repair/replace it.
