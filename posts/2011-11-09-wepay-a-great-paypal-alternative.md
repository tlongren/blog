I recently started using [WePay][1] as an alternative to PayPal. [WePay][1] has a lot going for them right now. There&#8217;s a lot of people looking for alternatives to PayPal, and [WePay][1] is a perfect alternative.

I&#8217;ve used PayPal for a very long time and have generally been very happy with it. Lately though, I&#8217;ve been having some issues related to people in other countries not being able to use PayPal anymore. Setting up recurring payments is a little more difficult than it should be too.  
[ad]  
[WePay][1] is a great alternative to PayPal. It&#8217;s really easy to setup, setup can be done in less than a minute.

One really nice feature of [WePay][1] is how they verify your bank account (if you choose to add one). Everyone knows that PayPal makes two micro-deposits to your bank account in order to verify it&#8217;s your account. [WePay][1] does that too, but it&#8217;s a last resort. To verify your account with WePay, you can either login to your bank account via the [WePay][1] website, or you can send a picture of your photo ID and check to WePay. Both are much faster than the micro-deposit route.

[WePay][1] also lets you create multiple &#8220;accounts&#8221;. So, you could have one account for beer money, another account for rent, and so on. Pretty handy.

So, if you&#8217;re looking for an alternative to PayPal, I suggest you give [WePay][1] a shot.
