I spent about an hour compiling [MySQL Workbench from source][1] earlier today. After about 20 newly satisfied dependencies and an hour of actual building, I fired it up and discovered I wasn&#8217;t able to connect to any MySQL server through an SSH tunnel, which I have to be able to do.

I was able to find a deb package, [mysql-workbench-gpl-5.2.39-1ubu1004-i386.deb][2], that seems to work quite well on Debian Squeeze 6.0.6. The package was mentioned in [this forum post at debian.net][3]. The package itself was the MySQL-provided deb for Ubuntu 10.04.

After I installed that deb, MySQL Workbench was able to connect to a MySQL server through an SSH tunnel. I must, must remember this for future Debian Squeeze installs.
