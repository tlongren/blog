Tune in in a couple weeks to hear the fate of the kitty&#8230;

This is the first, in what will probably be many, gripes about how kitty can go to hell. I refer to him simply as &#8220;Kitty&#8221;, instead of the gay ass name given to him by his owners wifey.

Brad&#8217;s new fucking kitty cat will die soon. It&#8217;s shit on the couch twice in the last 3 days. I took the covers off the couch and I could tell he had been pissin on one of them for a few days cuz it was stained already n shit.

I always leave slghtly empty pop cans on my desk. And remove them once too many gather. I woke up this morning to find Mt. Dew all over my keyboard, desk, mouse, and somehow monitor. I know it was that fucking cat walkin around up on my desk.

I dun even know why Brad got the damn thing. He didn&#8217;t even know it was out of food the other day. Completely out. I feed the fucker all the time, give him water and all that shit. Brad changes his litter box though. He&#8217;s only changed it twice since we&#8217;ve had the cat though. It prolly needs changed again, I&#8217;d imagine that&#8217;s why he&#8217;s shittin on the couch.

Now that the covers are off all pieces of the couch, the kitty will for sure die if he shits on it. I dun give a fuck. The life of one little kitty cat isn&#8217;t worth the time I have to spend dealing with him.

I been &#8220;killing kittens&#8221; for years now anyway (only [farkers][1] will know what I talkin bout)!
