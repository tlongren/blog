There&#8217;s currently an issue with comments as Dad pointed out to me. If you post a comment to an article, the next page you see will be blank. Don&#8217;t click refresh, just hit your back button, your comment will be posted.

This is a known issue in WordPress but I haven&#8217;t been able to find any solutions as of yet. Perhaps I&#8217;ll move to a slightly different comment system later this evening&#8230;

Any WordPress users out there have a solution for this problem? 

<div class="wpulike wpulike-default " >
  <div class="wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked">
    <button type="button"
					aria-label="Like Button"
					data-ulike-id="1774"
					data-ulike-nonce="66c8a9a1f8"
					data-ulike-type="likeThis"
					data-ulike-template="wpulike-default"
					data-ulike-display-likers="0"
					data-ulike-disable-pophover="0"
					class="wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_likethis_1774"></button><span class="count-box"></span>
  </div>
</div>
