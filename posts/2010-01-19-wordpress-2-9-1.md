[WordPress 2.9.1][1] was released a little over two weeks ago. You can [download][2] it at the [usual location][2].

From the release [announcement][1]:

> This release addresses a handful of minor issues as well as a rather annoying problem where scheduled posts and pingbacks are not processed correctly due to incompatibilities with some hosts. If any of these issues affect you, give 2.9.1 a try. [Download 2.9.1][2] or upgrade automatically from the Tools->Upgrade menu in your blogâ€™s admin area.

WordPress 2.9.1 came less than a month after [WordPress 2.9][3].
