Chances are good that I&#8217;ll be moving to Chicago sometime in August. Jeremy, my boss at <a href=http://www.jdws.net/>J.D. Web Services</a>, wants to move the company from Des Moines to Chicago. I&#8217;ll probably end up going with him. If I had to say right now, there&#8217;s probably a 95% chance that I&#8217;ll be moving there. We&#8217;re driving up there sometime next week to check out a few offices and apartments.
