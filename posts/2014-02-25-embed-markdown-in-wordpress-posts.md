## Easily embed markdown into WordPress posts and pages. {.subtitle}

There&#8217;s lots of [plugins to enable your entire post to be composed of Markdown][1], but what if you only want a piece of your post to be in Markdown? I shortcode sure would come in handy.

This is where the [Inline Markdown plugin][2] comes in to play. Just write your WordPress post as usual, and wrap any Markdown content in the <span class="lang:default decode:true  crayon-inline " ></p> 

<p>
  </span> shortcode.
</p>

<p>
  As an example, here&#8217;s a portion of the README from my Rootdip WordPress theme, that&#8217;s written in Markdown. Inline Markdown is an excellent tool for displaying entire README&#8217;s or portions of them from GitHub repos.
</p>

<h2>
  <strong>The <em>md shortcode</em> starts immediately following this line:</strong><br /> [md]Other Considerations
</h2>

<p>
  A majority of the images included in RootDip are from the <a href="http://somerandomdude.com/projects/iconic/" title="Iconic Icons!">iconic icon set</a> by <a href="http://somerandomdude.com/" title="Some Random Dude">P.J. Onori</a>. Images from Iconic are the tag, sticky post identifier, link post format identifier, status post format identifier, quote post format identifier and left and right arrows. I will likely use more images from Iconic as I add additional features/post formats to RootDip.
</p>

<h2>
  How To Contribute
</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    Fork it
  </li>
  <li>
    Create your feature branch (<code>git checkout -b my-new-feature</code>)
  </li>
  <li>
    Commit your changes (<code>git commit -am 'Add some feature'</code>)
  </li>
  <li>
    Push to the branch (<code>git push origin my-new-feature</code>)
  </li>
  <li>
    Create new Pull Request
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  <strong>And that&#8217;s it</strong>, end of the <em>md</em> shortcode is on the line above. I used the md shortcode like so to achieve that:
</p>

<pre><code>&lt;h2>Other Considerations&lt;/h2>

&lt;/ol>&lt;/code></pre>

  Pretty easy to do and really useful for embedding markdown from GitHub readme&#8217;s directly in your WordPress posts.
