[Cyanogenmod 7.1][1] was [released this past Monday][2]. This release is especially exciting for me, 7.1 brings official support to my [Motorola Defy][3]! Motorola Defy+ isn&#8217;t yet officially supported by Cyanogenmod, but I believe folks are working on it.

Lots of new devices are supported by Cyanogenmod 7.1. Other than the Motorola Defy, some other supported devices are the Motorola Droid 2, Motorola Droid X, Motorola Cliq / Cliq XT, Samsung Galaxy S, Samsung Galaxy S2, and many others. There&#8217;s also a number of devices in beta, those include Pyramid, Doubleshot, Shooter, HP Touchpad and Optimus 3D. A list of all the newly supported devices can be found at the end of this post.  
[ad]  
I flashed 7.1 to my Defy last night. Prior to Cyanogenmod 7.1 stable, I was running a nightly from a couple weeks back. The nightly build was extremely stable and I didn&#8217;t have any issues other than the proximity sensor not always working correctly. With the 7.1 update the proximity sensor seems to be fixed. The screen turns on when I move my phone away from my head.

If you&#8217;ve got a Motorola Defy, I really suggest you give Cyanogenmod 7.1 a try. It&#8217;s very much worth it, and getting it onto your phone is a lot easier than it may seem at first. The benefits are too many to list. I&#8217;m just amazed at how much smoother my Defy runs than it does on stock T-Mobile/Motorola Froyo. Animations and screen transitions are incredibly smooth and fluid.

You can find screenshots of my Defy running CM7.1 in the gallery below. I&#8217;m using the [JAMT White Gradient][4] CM7 theme by [ClassicalGas][5], and the ADW theme is [Android Honeycomb][6] by [Creative Themez][7].
