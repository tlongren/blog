[This is a really great idea][1]. It&#8217;s called the [popularity dialer][1]. What&#8217;s it do? Calls your cellphone at a date/time predefined by you. I can think of about a million situations when this would be very useful. Here&#8217;s a description from the [Popularity Dialer homepage][1]:

> Have you ever been in a situation where you wished your cell phone would ring? Maybe you wanted to look extra important or popular on that hot date. Or maybe you just needed an excuse to escape from an unpleasant meeting.
> 
> With &#8220;The Popularity Dialer&#8221;, you can plan ahead. Via a web interface, you can choose to have your phone called at a particular time (or several times). At the elected time, your phone will be dialed and you will hear a prerecorded message that&#8217;s one half of a conversation. Thus, you will be prompted to have a fake conversation and will easily fool those around you.

Hopefully I&#8217;ll be able to give it a try this weekend. It&#8217;s a very unique idea, hopefully they&#8217;re taking in enough donations to keep up and running for a while.
