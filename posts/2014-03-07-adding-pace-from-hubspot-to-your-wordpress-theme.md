[Pace.js][1], from [HubSpot][2], is pretty cool. It&#8217;s a page load progress bar that usually sits at the top of your website. The Minimial theme for Pace, which I like the best, gets hidden by the WordPress admin bar if you have it enabled. There&#8217;s a few different themes though, most work just fine with the WordPress admin bar.

HubSpot describes Pace better than I can.

> Include pace.js and a CSS theme of your choice, and you get a beautiful progress indicator for your page load and ajax navigation.
> 
> No need to hook into any of your code, progress is detected automatically.

Instead of downloading pace.js, I like to use [cdnjs][3] for this type of thing, [here&#8217;s pace.js on cdnjs.com][4].

In your `functions.php` file, just call the cdnjs file instead of a local file. You will, however, have to host the Pace theme CSS locally, which is usually tiny, unless you choose one of the more animated themes. I personally like the _Center Simple_ theme the best.

[<img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/longren.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/pace-styles-300x271.png?resize=300%2C271" alt="Pace Themes" width="300" height="271" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5714" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.longren.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/pace-styles.png?resize=300%2C271&ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.longren.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/pace-styles.png?resize=1024%2C927&ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/www.longren.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/pace-styles.png?w=1050&ssl=1 1050w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" />][5]

The `wp_enqueue_style()` call below loads `/css/pace.css` from your theme&#8217;s stylesheet directory. That&#8217;s the file that should contain the CSS provided by the Pace theme download.

<pre class="lang:php decode:true " >/**
* load_scripts
*
* load up css and javascript for Pace.js
*/
function load_scripts() {
    // load styles
    wp_enqueue_style( 'pace-css', get_stylesheet_directory_uri() . '/css/pace.css' ); // Center Simple Theme CSS

    // load javascript
    wp_enqueue_script( 'pace', 'http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/pace/0.4.17/pace.min.js' ); // pace.min.js
}
add_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', 'load_scripts' );</pre>

If your `functions.php` file already contains a `add_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', 'load_scripts' )`, find the function it calls, and add `wp_enqueue_style` and `wp_enqueue_script` there instead of making a new function like the example above.

This is more for theme developers to build into their themes as options and such, so if you&#8217;re a regular WordPress user you&#8217;d be better served by a functionality plugin. Essentially a plugin that you always have activated that adds all the necessary extra elements of the site, like the Pure JavaScript and CSS.

I&#8217;ll show how to create your own functionality plugin within the next few posts/days. If you want notified of when exactly it&#8217;s posted, subscribe below. Look for the **Get New Posts via E-Mail** heading.

**Update:** There&#8217;s [a plugin to do this][6], too.
