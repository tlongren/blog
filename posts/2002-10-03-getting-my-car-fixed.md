I should be getting my car fixed sometime next week. I&#8217;m having it done at Jim&#8217;s Auto in Story City, IA. I bought my car from this guy. My car was in a previous wreck, he rebuilt it. Total cost should be around $950. All the parts I&#8217;m getting are new and will be painted to match the color of my car.

I think Jim expects my parts to be in by Tuesday. He&#8217;s going to paint them and install them for me.
