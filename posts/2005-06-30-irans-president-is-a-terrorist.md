Yah, [he&#8217;s a terrorist indeed][1]. From the article.

> Soon after the Iranian Revolution in 1979, Ahmadinejad, who was studying in Tehranâ€™s University of Science and Technology, became a member of the central council of the Office for Strengthening of Unity Between Universities and Theological Seminaries, the main pro-Khomeini student body.
> 
> The OSU played a central role in the seizure of the United States embassy in Tehran in November 1979. Members of the OSU central council, who included Ahmadinejad as well as Ibrahim Asgharzadeh, Mohsen Mirdamadi, Mohsen Kadivar, Hashem Aghajari, and Abbas Abdi, were regularly received by Khomeini himself.
> 
> Former OSU officials involved in the takeover of the U.S. embassy said Ahmadinejad was in charge of security during the occupation, a key role that put him in direct contact with the nascent security organizations of the clerical regime and the Islamic Revolutionary Guards, which he later joined.

Dr. Rusty Shackleford [has photos to prove it][2]. It&#8217;s so obvious Iran is becoming a free state. I wonder if he was truly elected. Rusty does make a good point in his post saying &#8220;remember, it&#8217;s who counts the votes that matters in the end.&#8221;

I guess this really doesn&#8217;t suprise me as it is Iran after all. They&#8217;re not gonna simply clean up their act over one election. It&#8217;s all a show so the U.S. doesn&#8217;t attack.

[Right Wing Nut House][3] says The New York Times is still having trouble identifying the enemy. RWNH has some very interesting little nuggets of information.
