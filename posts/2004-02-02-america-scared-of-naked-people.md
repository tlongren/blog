I was reading on <a href=http://www.salon.com/>Salon.com about how Prez. Bush slept through the half-time show. Towards the bottom of the article, there&#8217;s a quote from White House spokesman Scott McClellan towards the bottom of the page:

> &#8220;Our view is, it&#8217;s important for families to be able to expect a high standard when it comes to programming.&#8221;

I understand that the White House has to take the most politically correct stance on every issue. I think it&#8217;s sad that sooo many people got pissed off at Janet Jackson&#8217;s tasseled nipple. Skin, is skin, is skin. The video of the event isn&#8217;t even very clear, when I first saw it, i had trouble telling if it was a real breast, or some sort of fake. I didn&#8217;t get to see it live, cuz the half-time shows are always worthless (guess I was wrong this time). If you&#8217;re interested, you can snag the video from the URL below:

_UPDATE_  
The old link stopped working, so here&#8217;s another that has a whole bunch of media involving the matter at hand.
