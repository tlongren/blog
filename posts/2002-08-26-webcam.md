I set up the web cam today. I&#8217;ve had it for along time, but never really used it. 

Anyway, go to the &#8220;Information&#8221; section and then to the &#8220;Webcam&#8221; section. The image is refreshed every 2 minutes. Most of the time you&#8217;ll see me sitting there. Sometimes you&#8217;ll see Dan sitting behind me. I won&#8217;t be on much though because my employer is no longer letting me work from home. And school starts Wednesday.

So, go check it out. Take in all my sexy-ness, and enjoy.
