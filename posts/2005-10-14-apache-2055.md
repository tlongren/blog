The Apache web server version 2.0.55 was released today. The previous 2.0 release was made back in April of this year. 2.0.55 fixes [a flaw][1] that was [discussed on Slashdot][2] in July. It&#8217;s mentioned in their official 2.0.55 [announcement][3].

> If a request contains both Transfer-Encoding and Content-Length headers, remove the Content-Length.  
> proxy_http: Correctly handle the Transfer-Encoding and Content-Length request headers. Discard the request Content-Length whenever chunked T-E is used, always passing one of either C-L or T-E chunked whenever the request includes a request body.
