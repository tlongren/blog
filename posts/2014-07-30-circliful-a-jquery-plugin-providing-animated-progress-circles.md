## Animated progress circles

I use something similar, but not quite as nice (these are animated progress circles) on my [Work With Me][1] page. They don&#8217;t have percentages and are just hacked together from codepen.io.

The [jquery-plugin-circliful][2] repository on GitHub is way more advanced than what I have on my [Work With Me][1] page. Cicliful provides animated progress circles, which you [can see on the demo page][3].

[Circulful][2] is very easy to use. Just include jQuery and the Circliful JavaScript and CSS on your page:

<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="html" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">&lt;link href="css/jquery.circlify.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" /&gt;

&lt;script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.2.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="js/jquery.circliful.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>

Add an element to your site with a unique ID:

<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="html" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">&lt;div id="myStat" data-dimension="250" data-text="35%" data-info="New Clients" data-width="30" data-fontsize="38" data-percent="35" data-fgcolor="#61a9dc" data-bgcolor="#eee" data-fill="#ddd" data-total="200" data-part="35" data-icon="long-arrow-up" data-icon-size="28" data-icon-color="#fff"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>

Then, to get the progress circle to appear, add this JavaScript: 

<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="html" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">&lt;script&gt;
$( document ).ready(function() {
        $('#myStat').circliful();
    });
&lt;/script&gt;</pre>

There&#8217;s a **lot** of optional [_data-_ attributes][4] that you can set, as well. The entire list is below, straight from the [README][5].

  * dimension / is the height and width of the element / default is 200px on 200px
  * text / will be deisplayed inside of the circle over the info element
  * info / will be deisplayed inside of the circle bellow the text element (can be empty if you dont want to show info text)
  * width / is the size of circle / default is 15px
  * fontsize / is the font size for the text element / default is 15px
  * percent / can be 1 to 100
  * fgcolor / is the foreground color of the circle / default is #556b2f
  * bgcolor / is the background color of the cicle / default is #eee
  * fill / is the background color of the whole circle (can be empty if you dont want to set a background to the whole circle)
  * type / full or half circle for example data-type=&#8221;half&#8221; if not set the circle will be a full circle / default full circle
  * total / If you want to display the percentage of a value for example you have 750MB Ram and at the moment are 350MB in use. You need to set data-total=&#8221;750&#8243; and data-part=&#8221;350&#8243; and the circle will show the percentage value 36,85% 
  * part
  * border / Will change the styling of the circle. The line for showing the percentage value will be displayed inline or outline.
  * icon / Fontawesome icon class without the fa- before the class for example not fa-plus just plus
  * iconsize / Will set the font size of the icon.
  * iconcolor / Will set the font color of the icon.
  * animationstep / Will set the animation step, use 0 to disable animation, 0.5 to slow down, 2 to speed up, etc / default is 1

Circliful is [available on GitHub][2], there&#8217;s [also a demo][3]. I&#8217;ll eventually switch the progress circles on my Work With Me page to use [Circliful][2]. I mostly enjoy it&#8217;s ease of customization through _data-_ attributes.

If you need help configuring something, feel free to leave a comment. Make sure you look through [the issues that have already been reported][6], too.
