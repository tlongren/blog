The machine that hosts this website is feeling much better. I removed all it&#8217;s scsi hard drives that weren&#8217;t being used. Also removed a dead 30gb IDE drive that was really loud.

For some reason, I had this shitty, off-brand power supply unit in it. One of the fans was bugging out, making a lot of noise. I happened to have a good Antec power supply in the closet. That Antec psu is much quieter and seems to produce more stable voltages to the motherboard.

I&#8217;m going to be needing more storage soon. I&#8217;m prolly gonna invest in a 160gb hard drive soon. Also a dvd burner.
