I blogged about this right after it happened. I think he did the right thing shooting the guy. I&#8217;d have shot him square in the head too. Anyway, the marine that shot the guy has been cleared of everything. The investigation found that the marine acted in self-defense.

Read this first @ [The Jawa Report][1] via [The Washington Times][2].

> The investigation into a controversial shooting of a wounded Iraqi by a U.S. Marine has ended with a determination the Marine acted in self defense.
> 
> The Marines announced no charges will be filed in the incident last November in which a Camp Pendleton infantryman shot a wounded Iraqi insurgent following a firefight around a mosque in the city of Fallujah.
> 
> The Marine told investigators he had, in fact, killed three wounded Iraqi fighters he feared still posed a threat to his unit.
> 
> Natonski reportedly gave serious consideration to intelligence reports that said injured insurgents in Fallujah had feigned surrender and then attacked American troops as they approached.

It&#8217;s superb they decided the marine acted in self defense. Why they had to do that anyway, I dunno as he&#8217;s a marine in a war. Personally, I think our troops fighting in Iraq should be given the ability to shoot anyone they deem a possible threat&#8230;no questions asked. The trouble makers in Iraq would probably settle down a little bit if this were the case.
