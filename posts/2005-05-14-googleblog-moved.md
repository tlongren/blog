I saw this on [Search Engine Roundtable][1] a day ago or so. Dunno why I didn&#8217;t post it before.

> I was checking my referral logs for today and I noticed referrals from <http://googleblog.blogspot.com/>. I first thought, is this a copycat site of the original www.google.com/googleblog/, where the original Google Blog resided. But no, click on <http://www.google.com/googleblog/> and it redirects you to http://googleblog.blogspot.com/. In addition, the URL being linked to from the [About Google][2] page (see left top) is http://googleblog.blogspot.com/. Not sure when that happened.
> 
> So finally, Google added a &#8220;What We&#8217;re Reading&#8221; section. Of course, I am honored to have this site included in the list. Glad you are reading. ðŸ™‚

And here&#8217;s what Eric from the GoogleBlog team had to say about it:

> To make the Google Blog a bit easier to manage behind the scenes, we&#8217;re now publishing it to its new home at Blogspot: <http://googleblog.blogspot.com/>
> 
> [Newsreader][3] users shouldn&#8217;t have to re-subscribe; the Atom feed is being redirected to its [new URL][4]. We&#8217;ve also updated the design a bit, and added a [blogroll][5]. [Let us know][6] what you think.

Seems like a decent choice to me. Although I would have kept the original URL and just used the &#8220;[Blogger][7]&#8221; system. Whatever though. 

<div class="wpulike wpulike-default " >
  <div class="wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked">
    <button type="button"
					aria-label="Like Button"
					data-ulike-id="1875"
					data-ulike-nonce="ffb009eb4b"
					data-ulike-type="likeThis"
					data-ulike-template="wpulike-default"
					data-ulike-display-likers="0"
					data-ulike-disable-pophover="0"
