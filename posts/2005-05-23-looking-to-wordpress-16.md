WordPress 1.5.1.1 was recently released as many of you know. So, what&#8217;s in store for 1.6 you may ask? A number of import/export features are planned as well as a link manager overhaul. Some neat sounding template additions are slated too. That includes versioning of template files, it&#8217;ll save the last three copies. I assume this is going to be implemented in the WordPress admin interface where you currently edit templates.

A list of features that will be in 1.6 [can be found here][1], on the [WordPress Codex][2]. [Blogging Pro][3] pointed the way to [this little item][3] for me. 

<div class="wpulike wpulike-default " >
  <div class="wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked">
    <button type="button"
					aria-label="Like Button"
					data-ulike-id="1891"
					data-ulike-nonce="5c3786cd0c"
					data-ulike-type="likeThis"
					data-ulike-template="wpulike-default"
					data-ulike-display-likers="0"
					data-ulike-disable-pophover="0"
					class="wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_likethis_1891"></button><span class="count-box"></span>
  </div>
</div>
