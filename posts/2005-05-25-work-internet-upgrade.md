Well, we got our new modem yesterday. This was an upgrade by Iowa Telecom. MidIowa Net just resells their DSL service. They scheduled the upgrade from between 9:00 am and 2:00 pm. I dunno why they didn&#8217;t do it at night. Doesn&#8217;t make much sense to me.

I installed the new modem this morning around 9:30. Internet came back on around 10:30. Most people in the Nevada office are in Ankeny this morning for a bunch of meetings about some new diet lines. It&#8217;s good that most people are gone on the day that the intenet was out for a few hours. I&#8217;m just glad it didn&#8217;t take until 2:00 pm, I have to check for orders online at noon. I probably would have just downloaded the orders at home during lunch if we didn&#8217;t have internet by noon.

The speeds increase wasn&#8217;t very great. I get a little over 60kb/sec down. Mediacom, my cable ISP at home, is starting the 5Mbit down upgrades. There&#8217;s been reports of people in Dubuque, IA getting 5Mbit down. I&#8217;m gonna reset my modem when I go home for lunch to see if anything has changed for me.
