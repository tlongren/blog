I formatted my / partition lastnight and installed slackware-current. The ftp server is down. This website was down for about 2 hours last night. I dunno when ftp access will be up again.

If you had an FTP account, it&#8217;s prolly gone now. I dun even know if I want to allow ftp access anymore. It was sucking up too much bandwidth. My total bandwidth usage last month was 71.9GB. Of that, 29.6GB was outbound traffic.

Almost too much for my liking. If I had a 512kbps upstream, then no prob&#8230;but I only have 256kbps upstream.
