<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.longren.org/images/xbox360_elite_full.jpg" rel="thumbnail" title="Xbox 360 Elite"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.longren.org/images/xbox360_elite_thumb.jpg?resize=100%2C74" width="100" height="74" alt="Xbox 360 Elite" align="left" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>After months of speculation, Microsoft has finally [announced the Xbox 360 Elite][1]. Everything included with the Xbox 360 Elite is black instead of white, like the initial Xbox 360. One of the major additions to the Xbox 360 Elite is full HDMI support. There&#8217;s also a 120GB hard drive, much larger than the 20GB that came with my Xbox 360 Premium package.

I won&#8217;t be purchasing an Xbox 360 Elite. I would like to have a 120GB hard drive, but I can buy one for my premium system later on. I can&#8217;t justify paying $479.99 for a 120GB drive, I couldn&#8217;t even use the HDMI support. I do like the black though, very sleek looking. 

[The Xbox Domain has some more specs][2] on the Xbox 360 Elite. They also have some prices for the new accessories.

>   * 120GB hard drive (black)
>   * HDMI (high-definition multimedia interface) port
>   * Wireless controller (black)
>   * Xbox LIVE headset (black)
>   * HDMI cable
>   * Component/SD cable
>   * One month subscription to Xbox Live Gold

[Xbox Live&#8217;s Major Nelson has an interview][3] with [Albert][4] on the new Xbox 360 Elite. He&#8217;s also got a [Flickr photoset][5] containing a bunch of pictures of the new Xbox 360 Elite and the new accessories. Pretty neat.

[Xbox 360 Fanboy has a large post][6] highlighting all the new features and accessories for the Xbox 360 Elite. [Joystiq has pretty much the same info][7], but with more pictures.
