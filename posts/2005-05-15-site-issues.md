I&#8217;m not exactly sure what&#8217;s going on here yet. WordPress claims to have trouble connecting to the mysql server. I upgraded kernels lastnight. I updated to the most recent WordPress build, which is 1.5.1.1-beta. It could be either of those I suppose. Probably more likely the second.

Here&#8217;s what you&#8217;ll see if it&#8217;s messing up:

If you notice this will you please contact me? Either by posting a comment, using the contact page, or [e-mailing me][1]. Thanks!

**UPDATE:**  
I reverted back to an older codebase I was using, so it&#8217;s fixed for now. I think it was a couple comment/trackback plugins I had installed that were causing the problem. They&#8217;ve since been removed and everything should be back to normal. I tested in Lynx on a remote system and it worked well in that, so&#8230;if it works in Lynx it should work in about everything.
