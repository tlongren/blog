The fact that blogs and the news are covering this freaks me out a little bit. I&#8217;m sorta disappointed in the blogosphere for continuing to cover this&#8230;I&#8217;ll just add to the pile.

I remember having to watch Pat Robertson on _The 700 Club_ when I&#8217;d go to the babysitters in the morning. This was when I was really little. Even then I remember not listening to what he had to say. I knew he was just talking to get money for god. I&#8217;ve always thought he was pretty much insane. That&#8217;s why I can&#8217;t figure out why so many people put so much weight in what he said about assisinating Chavez.

Now, there&#8217;s no doubt that Chavez is a dangerous guy. Just [check out what Danny Carlton][1] (Jack) had to say about him in his commtary today. He&#8217;s also got a good post about what [Chavez is up to][2] and where all his money goes. Sounds like he likes to play with his military. Can&#8217;t say I blame him.

[Stones Cry Out][3] have a post entitled &#8220;An Embarrassing Retraction by Robertson&#8221;. It&#8217;s actually pretty funny. Sounds like Jim put a lot of thought into it.

[Robertson Activates Christian Sleeper Cells][4] is a very funny satire post over at [Right Wing News][5].

What&#8217;s almost even funnier is the fact that a Finnish christian TV station [is dropping The 700 Club][6] because of what Robertson said. Way to go guys!

Personally, I think we should assisinate Chavez. Too bad it&#8217;s illegal. We should repeal whatever law it is that prevents political assisinations. I think it&#8217;s [executive order 12333][7]. Well, I take that back. He should be assisinated if he does anything to antagonize us. Forget what he&#8217;s done in the past, focus on now and the future. If he can shut up and be a good little dictator/president, then we should leave him alone.

Castro is gonna be a bad influence on him.

**UPDATE:** [Ace of Spades HQ][8] has basically the whole entire thing right. Ace touched on pretty much every aspect of how the U.S. should react. Didn&#8217;t the U.S. government play a role in killing Pablo Escobar?
