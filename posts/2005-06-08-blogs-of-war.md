[Blogs of War][1], one of my favorite blogs, has undergone [some major changes][2]. John moved the site over to [Drupal][3] from WordPress. I noticed the change a few days ago. A couple days ago John added trackbacking ability to the site. I really like the new look of the site. It&#8217;s much easier to read. Drupal seems to be pretty popular these days.

[Take Back the News][4], also operated by John, still has the old Blogs of War look, running WordPress. I&#8217;ve noticed a couple bugs in the new Blogs of War site, but that&#8217;s to be expected for a little while. Overall I like it very well. Even more than I previously did&#8230;

One really neat thing about the new site is the various RSS feeds from other sites. It&#8217;s like an entirely different site within the Blogs of War site. I also noticed John had added my RSS feed to the [Civilian Tech Blogs][5] section.
