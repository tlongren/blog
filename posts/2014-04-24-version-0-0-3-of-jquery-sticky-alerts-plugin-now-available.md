I&#8217;ve released version 0.0.3 of my [Sticky Alerts jQuery plugin][1]. It&#8217;s [available on GitHub][2] and is [now indexed at plugins.jquery.com][3].

I&#8217;ve added a feature to remember if the bar has been closed or not. This is done via cookies, and there&#8217;s an option to set. The option, `cookieRememberDays`, default to `2`. If you want to disable it (ie: bar will appear every time the page is loaded no matter what), you need to set `cookieRememberDays` to a value of ``.

To keep the **bar closed for 7 days**, do something like this:

<pre class="lang:js decode:true " >$('#alert-container').stickyalert({
  barFontColor:'#eee',
  barColor:'#222',
  barFontSize: '1.1rem',
  barText:'Hey, need some web work done? Give me a shout!',
  barTextLink:'http://longren.io/work-with-me/',
  cookieRememberDays: '7'
});</pre>

To **keep it as-is, and make the bar open on every page load**, do this:

<pre class="lang:js decode:true " >$('#alert-container').stickyalert({
  barFontColor:'#eee',
  barColor:'#222',
  barFontSize: '1.1rem',
  barText:'Hey, need some web work done? Give me a shout!',
  barTextLink:'http://longren.io/work-with-me/',
  cookieRememberDays: '0'
});</pre>
