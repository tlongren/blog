Patrick J. Volkerding, the man behind [Slackware][1] has been really sick lately. In his most recent update to slackware-current, he posted a request for assistance from the community.

This was mentioned on [OSNews.com][2]. They mention that he&#8217;s suffering from a genetic disorder called Marfan&#8217;s syndrome. I don&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s a life-threatening disease, which is good. I&#8217;ve read about it a bit about it on the internet, it sounds to be more of a nuisance than anything.

Patrick is looking for help in recieving the medicine he needs to get better. He&#8217;s been traveling all over the U.S. to hospitals. Last I heard, he was at the Mayo clinic.

People are acting like he&#8217;s dead. Asking what&#8217;s going to happen to Slackware? Slackware is gonna die! blah, blah blah. Pat&#8217;s not dead. If the worst case scenerio was to occur, there&#8217;d still be people to take over the maintaining of Slackware.

Here&#8217;s Pat&#8217;s official message to the community asking for help:
