My favorite RSS feed reader, [NewsAlloy][1], is [down for an unknown amount of time][2]. This message is currently being displayed on the [NewsAlloy home page][1]:

> Unfortunately our HDD was full today. And unexpectedly we have to start moving tables again.

> Bad thing that we do not have any sponsor or investor and News Alloy is running only for cost of its creator(s) 🙁 .

The [lead developer says][3] their server costs are between $2000 and $2500 USD per month. I hope this service does indeed make a comeback, because it&#8217;s the best web based feed reader IMO. I&#8217;m all for donating money, but I feel we&#8217;ll just be back in this boat again in another few months.

Perhaps I should offer my English language services to the developers. I think they&#8217;d get more assistance if they were better able to communicate with those likely to invest money.
