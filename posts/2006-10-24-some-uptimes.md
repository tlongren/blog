[<img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/static.flickr.com/86/278291075_79ff53939f_m.jpg?resize=240%2C90" width="240" height="90" alt="uptimes" align="left" data-recalc-dims="1" />][1]I like to know how long each of my boxes have been up and running. I really don&#8217;t care so much about Windows PC&#8217;s, but I really like knowing how long my Linux boxes have been up. Notifications of uptimes are very nice, if a server goes down, I&#8217;ll get an email letting me know it&#8217;s no longer up and running.

Anyway, for the last year and a half or more I&#8217;ve been using [The Uptime Project from MrEriksson][2]. I don&#8217;t think the project is being developed or even maintained any longer, but it still works very well. All you need to do is get a username and password then download the client for your operating system.

But, I just wanted to point out that one uptime, [for router.longren.org][3]. It&#8217;s got an uptime of 155 days, almost half a year, by far the best uptime for any box I&#8217;ve personally owned. The neat thing about The Uptime Project is that it records reboots and total downtime.
