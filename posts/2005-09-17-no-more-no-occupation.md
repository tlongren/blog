[Cindy Sheehan is back][1], and stupider than ever. I read about this a little bit yesterday before I unplugged myself for the day.

> ‚ÄúYou know something, Billy? I don‚Äôt care if a human being is black, brown, white, yellow or pink, or if she‚Äôs Christian, Muslim, Jew, Buddhist, or pagan. I don‚Äôt care what flag a person salutes: if a human being is hungry, then it is up to another human being to feed him/her. George Bush needs to stop talking, admit the mistakes of his all around failed administration, **pull our troops out of occupied New Orleans** and Iraq, and excuse his self from power. The only way America will become more secure is if we have a new administration that cares about Americans even if they don‚Äôt fall into the top two percent of the wealthiest.‚Äù

Did ya read that? Pretty retarded huh? I just can&#8217;t believe she&#8217;s still out there being the huge attention whore she is. I know, I know, I&#8217;m only contributing to her continued 15 minutes of fame. I think it&#8217;s been about 30 -45 minutes of fame now. Either way she&#8217;s obviously totally detached from any sort of reality. I may write some space-man type shit sometimes, but come on, pull troops out of New Orleans?

Cindy is obviously racist. She&#8217;d rather we leave New Orleans so everyone left will just die. Not really, but I can use the same mentality she does, right?

[Mark in Mexico][2] has a huge list of people covering this along with commentary. [California Conservative][3] has a few updates on this matter. [The Political Teen][4] thinks Cindy is just pissed at Katrina for stealing her news coverage. I don&#8217;t think he could be more right. [Political Musings][5] doesn&#8217;t know what&#8217;s worse. The fact that our left takes Cindy seriously or the fact that she&#8217;s still getting news coverage. [TigerHawk][6] calls for an end to the occupation of New Orleans too!

There&#8217;s a few trackback parties I&#8217;m participating in. Follow the links, there&#8217;ll definately be some good reads at the following links:
