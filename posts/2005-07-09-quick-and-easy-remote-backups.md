I backup my database, website, and my home directory on a daily basis to a remote server via [SSH][1] and [rsync][2]. Rsync is a tool that synchronizes directories. I also use it for grabbing current copies of slackware-10.1 and slackware-current.

It&#8217;s really easy to backup files to a remote server with these tools. I create tar archives of my needed directories and store the current ones in /opt/backups. I&#8217;ve made various bash scripts to do this on a daily basis for me automatically. After that&#8217;s complete, the code shown below is run. It transfers my /opt/backups directory to the remote server. It&#8217;s path on the remote server would be /home/tyler/backups. All you need to do is set the SERVER variable to the hostname of the server you&#8217;re backing up to.

The hardest part is finding a remote server that you&#8217;re able to backup to. If you&#8217;re lucky, your web host will allow you SSH access. There&#8217;s no need for the server end to have rsync installed. All it needs is SSH. I know [BlueHost][3] gives account holders SSH access. They&#8217;ve been hosting our sites at work for a while now and promptly gave me an SSH account. Their sites said they&#8217;d need an ID, but they didn&#8217;t require one from me for one reason or another. I backup to a freinds Linux box that&#8217;s located in a datacenter somewhere.
