As many already know, a major torrent site, [EliteTorrents.org][1] was shutdown today. First there were reports the site had been DNS hijacked. Eventually their was a page up claiming to be from the FBI. Many thought it was a fake or even a site defacement. Then [ICE][2] (U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement) posted [this interesting piece][3] about EliteTorrents. The ICE website is pretty slow. Boing Boing has [mirrors of the files][4].

The screenshot ICE provides is amusing to me. You&#8217;ll notice the title of the video they have playing in VNC (the video player) is clearly a trailer. It&#8217;s only a couple minutes in length. And in the background they have the EliteTorrents site showing with a copy of Star Wars Revenge of the Sith up, ready to be downloaded. [Digital Warfighter has the text][5] of the FBI message, incase the site isn&#8217;t even accessible soon.
