Stephen Dupont, an Australian photojournalist, snapped some photos of American soldiers burning the bodies of some Taliban terrorists. Throughout the media, this is being portrayed as evidence of American atrocities in the middle east. Apparently, Mr. Dupont says it was clear the bodies were being burned for sanitary reasons.

I don&#8217;t know how I&#8217;ve missed this bit of news over the last week, there&#8217;s people blogging it all freakin over the place. Almost too much information for me to sort out right now. Anyway, the media is being blamed for spinning this story at least 180 degrees. There&#8217;s reports that people within the U.S. military psy-ops divisions burned the bodies in an attempt to lure out other Taliban fighters. There seems to be debate going on as to wether or not burning the bodies for psy-ops purposes was &#8220;ethical&#8221; I guess.

I really hope that&#8217;s not what all the fuss is really about. It&#8217;s one of the most effective forms of psy-ops. Saddam used it, the Taliban uses it. When Saddam was into chopping off womens heads, he&#8217;d have their heads placed on poles outside their homes for everyone to see. In turn sending the message that your head could be on a pole should you go against his regime.

And remember when the those American contractors were hung from the bridge in Fallujah? Yet another classic example of psy-ops, only it&#8217;s not being used by U.S. troops, so it&#8217;s OK. That&#8217;s basically what this all boils down to I think. It&#8217;s OK for everyone else to employ every tactic possible, but when the U.S. does it, it&#8217;s evil and we must be taught a lesson.

And that just brings us back to the fundamental problems with Islam and the MSM&#8217;s willingness to tear down the United States. Both of which are deep rooted problems that can&#8217;t be dealt with without taking extreme actions.

That&#8217;s probably it for me on this. Check out what everyone else has to say, it&#8217;s probably much more relavent to this story than the generalities I spoke of. Cao and Euphoric Reality have probably the most comprehensive posts:
