[<img src="https://i2.wp.com/songbirdnest.com/files/images/button_headphones.png?w=1100" border="0" alt="Get Songbird" align="left" data-recalc-dims="1" />][1]I&#8217;ve been using [Songbird 0.2][2] all day long. The first thing I noticed was how slow Songbird is at parsing ID3 tags. I&#8217;ve only got 1,276 songs in my library and it took 5+ minutes to scan all those mp3 files and figure out the artists/albums.

The volume seems flaky too. I&#8217;ll set the volume and go work on something else, and I swear it sounds like the volume is rising and falling slightly as I work with other applications.

I really like the interface, it&#8217;s very quick and responsive, and it looks pretty too. I really can&#8217;t believe how responsive it is. I sort of expected it to be on par with iTunes, slow as hell.

If you&#8217;re going to give Songbird a try, the [minimize to tray plugin][3] is a must. Well, it is for me, I hate clutter on my taskbar. Songbird 0.2 has been very stable for me so far, it hasn&#8217;t crashed or died unexpectedly once. I will probably end up sticking with Songbird as my main music player, mostly because it&#8217;s cross-platform.
