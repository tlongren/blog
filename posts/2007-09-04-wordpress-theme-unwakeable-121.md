I hadn&#8217;t planned on releasing another version of [Unwakeable][1] in the 1.x series, yet here it is. The release of Unwakeable 1.2.1 was prompted after the [discovery of a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability][2] in the Unwakeable search functions.  
<!--adsense-->

  
The vulnerability makes it possible for people to run malicious code that could, for example, steal all the cookies from your domain. You can [download Unwakeable 1.2.1][3] from the official [Unwakeable page][1]. There are no new features in Unwakeable 1.2.1. The only difference between 1.2 and 1.2.1 is the fix for the XSS vulnerability.

If you&#8217;re already using version 1.2 and don&#8217;t want to bother upgrading, I&#8217;ve put together [a post describing the steps][2] to take to patch the vulnerability in Unwakeable 1.2.

I apologize for the inconvenience and please let me know if you have any issues with Unwakeable 1.2.1.
