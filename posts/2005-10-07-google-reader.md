Google announced [Google Reader][1] at the [Web 2.0 Conference][2]. It&#8217;s supposed to make it easier to manage lots and lots of feeds. Check out [the tour][3] for more on how the whole thing works.

I&#8217;ve used it a little, not much yet though as it seems to be running incredibly slow at the moment. I really like how it shows your different feeds and how it displays articles from the feed. It&#8217;s got a nice interface but needs a lot of little things done to it. There&#8217;s really no confirmation after you click the &#8220;subscribe&#8221; button, when you go back to your Reader home, you&#8217;ll be notified of feeds you&#8217;ve recently subscribed to.

Hopefully it&#8217;s not truly as slow as it currently is. There&#8217;s no way in hell I could use it at this speed. It looks fun though. Thanks to [Matt][4] for the news. [Om Malik&#8217;s Broadband Blog][5] and [Between The Lines][6] have the news too.

**UPDATE:** I think Google Reader was getting hammered with requests earlier. It&#8217;s much snappier now and has an interface very similar to that of Gmail. I like it, I dun care what anyone says. I still love you Google, dun listen to all those haters. I&#8217;ve already forgotten about the failed web accelerator&#8230;
