That&#8217;s right. [Comcast][1] has been used for disclosing customer information to the [RIAA][2]. I&#8217;m very interested to see how this turns out. I love hearing stories where ISP&#8217;s refuse to give the RIAA or MPAA any customer information. I wish all companies would take a stance like that.

Supposedly, no court authorized Comcast to give away personal information about their customers. I doubt a court would need to have a say in it though as copyright infringement was taking place.

Read the story @ [C|Net News.com][3].
