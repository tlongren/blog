A lot of people ask me what I use for a daily ROM. I really like stock, but I do like a bit more customization. Stock is perfect for my wife though, especially with [DashClock][1] and [Eye In The Sky Weather][2]. 

I&#8217;ve been using the [PURITY ROM][3] for the last couple of months, along with the [Purified kernel][4].

As of this post, I&#8217;m on the August 26 PURITY ROM build and on the r172-stable Purified kernel. Also using the [latest Android 4.3 gapps core][5] from Michael Banks.

I host a mirror for [Banks Gapps][6], and for the [Purified Kernel][7]. You should check it out, if you haven&#8217;t already been there for Banks Gapps at one point.

So, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m running, and will continue to run as long as both projects are in development. Until something better comes along, but probably not until my next phone.

There&#8217;s a gallery below with various screenshots of PURITY ROM, with [Nova Launcher Prime][8], and various iconsets. They&#8217;re just random screenshots I&#8217;ve taken over the last couple months.
