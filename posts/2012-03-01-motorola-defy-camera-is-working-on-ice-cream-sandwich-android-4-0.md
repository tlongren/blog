Quarx released a new build for Defy and Defy+ yesterday. I am now running on his Defy+ build because camera in it works with regular Motorola Defy&#8217;s with a red camera lens. 

Now that everyone has a partially working camera, all Defy/Defy+ users should be quite happy.

If you&#8217;ve got a Red lens Defy, and want to run Ice Cream Sandwich and have a working camera, follow the steps below.

First, you&#8217;ll need some files.

  * [CM9 Kernel][1]
  * [Defy+ 20120302 Nightly][2]
  * [Latest Gapps][3]
  * [Battery fix from Auris][4]

[ad]  
<!--more-->

  
Once you have those files, follow the steps below.

  1. Clear data/factory reset.
  2. Flash CM9 kernel.
  3. Flash Defy+ ICS zip.
  4. Flash Gapps.
  5. Flash battery charge fix.
  6. Wipe cache.
  7. Wipe dalvik cache.
  8. Done, reboot.

Some things to keep in mind:

  1. No Hardware Acceleration (HWA).
  2. Video playback is extremely slow (unusable really), probably due to no HWA yet. 
  3. Chrome Beta doesn&#8217;t work, also due to no HWA.
