## Webfonts that actually look good {.subtitle}

[Brick][1] is a collection of great looking fonts. It&#8217;s open source, so anyone can contribute, and can be [found on GitHub][2].

The mission statement from the [Brick site][1]:

> In the age of the Internet, we&#8217;ve found ourselves in yet another typographic battle. In an effort to speed up loading times, we&#8217;ve compressed fonts, and along the way, we&#8217;ve lost the majority of the quality of rendered type.
> 
> Let&#8217;s change that. The fonts served by Brick are clones of the original, converted without modification to WOFF format for high quality rendering and fast loading across all modern browsers.

The fonts are served from the [Fastly CDN][3], which is backed by Linode&#8217;s infrastructure.

A list of [fonts can be found here][4], and [usage instructions can be found here][5].

### Is Brick actually better?

I dunno. Maybe.

Brick provides a comparison, showing [Brick fonts][6], and [Google Web Fonts][7]. Make sure to read the [readme for tips][2] on spotting the differences between the two, they may not be obvious to an untrained eye (like mine).

I&#8217;ve been a fan of Google Web Fonts, but may try Brick for my next project.
