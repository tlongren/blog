The Senate has voted 49 to 42 on an amendment to a military budget bill that will strip some rights currently retained by detainees. These detainees are detainees for a reason, they shouldn&#8217;t get rights the average prisoner gets. From the [NYT][1]:

> WASHINGTON, Nov. 10 &#8211; The Senate voted Thursday to strip captured &#8220;enemy combatants&#8221; at GuantÃ¡namo Bay, Cuba, of the principal legal tool given to them last year by the Supreme Court when it allowed them to challenge their detentions in United States courts.
> 
> The vote, 49 to 42, on an amendment to a military budget bill by Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, comes at a time of intense debate over the government&#8217;s treatment of prisoners in American custody worldwide, and just days after the Senate passed a measure by Senator John McCain banning abusive treatment of them.
> 
> If approved in its current form by both the Senate and the House, which has not yet considered the measure but where passage is considered likely, the law would nullify a June 2004 Supreme Court opinion that detainees at GuantÃ¡namo Bay had a right to challenge their detentions in court.

What the hell? It&#8217;s more upsetting to me that these criminals have these sorts of rights. Gotta love sucking up to the enemy. And from [WAPO][2]:

> Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he also faces some resistance from Senate colleagues and the White House as he considers whether to try attaching his proposal to a defense bill the Senate is debating this week. Senators could vote on the proposal as early as Thursday.
> 
> &#8220;What I object to is criminalizing the war. Enemy combatants, POWs have never had access to federal court before,&#8221; said Graham, a 20-year Air Force lawyer.

Well put Senator Graham. It only makes sense that we shouldn&#8217;t allow the enemy access to our federal court system. They have no place being there, their place is in prison. No doubt the ACLU will throw a fit. Many liberal bloggers are already whining and crying for the rights of these criminals and murders. Before we know it we&#8217;ll be forced to grant these people citizenship within the United States. I&#8217;m sure the ACLU would be happy with that.

We&#8217;re at war. Allowing prisoners, who are fighting for the opposing side, to appeal their cases is totally bogus and goes against all basic logic.
