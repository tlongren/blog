Well, it seems Mediacom is finally rolling out a free speed increase for everyone. At the same price we pay now, we&#8217;ll get 5Mbps down and still just 256Kbps up. There&#8217;s also going to be a higher-end tier of service which will offer 10Mbps down and 1Mbit up. I&#8217;m probably gonna go ahead and get the high-end service just because 1Mbps up would kick ass. I&#8217;d actually be able to play Halo 2 online without almost constant lag. I was hoping to see them give us 512Kbps up at no extra charge, but I dun think that&#8217;ll happen. There&#8217;s a lot of people that are kinda angry about the upload remaining the same&#8230;
