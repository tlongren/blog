This is interesting stuff. It deals with Mediacom (my ISP) and AT&T. Mediacom customers in Illinois and some parts of Iowa haven&#8217;t been able to use any sort of P2P application. This hasn&#8217;t been the case for me&#8230;I&#8217;ve been using BitTorrent without any problems.

Supposedly, a tech guy from Mediacom said he heard that the RIAA told AT&T that those certain areas being affected are high in file-sharing traffic. This leads some people to believe that AT&T is blocking P2P traffic per RIAA&#8217;s request. I&#8217;m not sure about that though. Verizon told the RIAA to screw off when it tried to obtain info on a Verizon customer so they could sue him.

If AT&T is indeed blocking P2P networks, they should stop soon. Probably 85% of the people affected have said they&#8217;ll cancel their Mediacom account if the problem isn&#8217;t resolved. People get broadband for P2P. There&#8217;s a news piece about it here:

And they&#8217;re talking about this in the [Slyck][1] forums too:
