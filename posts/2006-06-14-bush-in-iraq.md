The Bush administration has seen it&#8217;s [fair share of good news][1] in the last few weeks. Well deserved good news too.

> In a White House that had virtually forgotten what good news looks like, the past few weeks have been refreshing. A Republican won a much-watched special congressional election. President Bush recruited a Wall Street heavy hitter as Treasury secretary. U.S. forces killed the leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq. And now the architect of the Bush presidency has avoided criminal charges.

The death of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi is a big one. That guy has been responsible for so much violence in Iraq, it&#8217;s great seeing him bite the dust.

> With Zarqawi dead, a new Baghdad government in place and Rove freed from prosecutor&#8217;s cross hairs, the White House hopes it can pivot to a new stage in which it is no longer on the defensive. In recent weeks, under new Chief of Staff Joshua B. Bolten, the White House has tried to do more to set an agenda, moving aggressively into the immigration debate and agreeing to join direct talks with Iran over its nuclear program under certain conditions.

Anyway, Bush made a &#8220;secret&#8221; visit to Iraq yesterday. Some think he may be laying the groundwork for troop reductions in Iraq. I don&#8217;t really see that though. To me it seems to be more of a pep-rally sort of thing. Bush was there letting everyone know that we need to stay until the job is done. Or at least until the Iraqi forces are able to handle the insurgents on their own. Even when the Iraqi forces are ready, we should still maintain a military force in the country, just to ensure the job is done right. It&#8217;d be terribly depressing if the country fell into a civil war or something once the U.S. packs up and leaves. In my eyes, we need to have a decent number of troops there for the next 50 years, just to protect our investment. &#8220;Our investment&#8221; being the nation of Iraq itself, not their oil.

[Flopping Aces][2] has some nice pictures and a video. [Hot Air][3] also has the video and a link to the transcript from Bush&#8217;s speech.
