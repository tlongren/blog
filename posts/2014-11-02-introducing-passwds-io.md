## Pronounceable Password Generator {.subtitle}

I&#8217;d had this code sitting around for a while and decided to [make a new site dedicated to it][1]. It&#8217;s called [passwds.io][1]. It&#8217;s a simple service that produces pseudo-random passwords that have some elements that can actually be pronounced, hopefully making them easier to remember.

I do not recall where I got the original code to generate the _pronounceable_ passwords, but am trying to find the source so I can credit where it&#8217;s deserved.

I threw thew site at [passwds.io][1] together in about an hour using the newest [Bootstrap][2], [PHP][3], and [jQuery][4].

[Brandon Lighter][5] brought up the fact that I could be [storing all generated passwords][6], but I&#8217;m not. This was developed as a tool for myself to use while I was a sys admin at a large local business, I&#8217;d use it to create new passwords for users in Active Directory. It&#8217;s still the same code.

Once I can bring the code to a level that isn&#8217;t so scattered, I will put it on GitHub so everyone can see the source and what&#8217;s going on. It&#8217;s really very, very simple.

Of course, I could omit the important &#8220;logging&#8221; piece when pushing to GitHub, but at some point people just have to trust others, and I&#8217;m flat out saying there&#8217;s no type of logging being done at [passwds.io][1], other than the standard [Google Analytics][7] and [Gaug.es][8] for site analytics/

Brandon does bring up good points though, like no usage of special characters.

> Secondly, they are only lower-case, upper-case, and numbers, which means you are pulling from a much smaller character set than you could be, making brute-force attacks easier. 

I may add an option to do pronounceable passwords, or passwords with special characters enabled, which would probably break pronounceability. But options are always nice.

If you have other suggestions, I&#8217;d love to hear them. I&#8217;ve debated adding user accounts and the ability to save your generated passwords (that would be accessible only by you), but that sort of goes beyond the scope of [passwds.io][1], which is simple, fast password password creation.

An example output from passwds.io can be seen in the screenshot below.
