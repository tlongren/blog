A company called [TendonUSA][1] contacted me the other day offering me the opportunity to try out some of their products, all of which are cables of various types. They have a fair number of cable products, from ethernet cables to HDMI cables. The one product I wish they had but don&#8217;t (it&#8217;s not on their website at least) is retractable ethernet cables. I&#8217;m hoping they have some in development for release sometime soon, they&#8217;re so cool!  
<!--adsense-->

  
Their [CAT6 ethernet cables][2] immediately caught my eye. Their ethernet cables have a feature called _EasyConnect_, which, if I understand it correctly, replaces the little clip found on traditional RJ-45 plugs with a simple push button. That&#8217;s excellent for me, because I have to replace the traditional RJ-45 plugs far too often at work due to broken clips. The EasyConnect feature sounds like it would totally put an end to that little nuisance. No little clips to break on ethernet cables would be dreamy.

The representative from TendonUSA who emailed me compared the quality of their cables to that of Monster Cable and Belkin. Both Monster Cable and Belkin are way overpriced in my opinion, which could have something to do with lack of competition in the high quality cable market. TendonUSA has much more reasonable prices on all their cables, which is great, assuming the quality and performance is there. Hopefully they can bring some competition to the high quality cable market and drive prices down a little. I&#8217;m sorry, but $30 for a simple USB printer cable is just madness.  
<!--adsense-->

  
On the [TendonUSA about page][3], they describe why Tendon cables are cheaper and how they can maintain such high quality in their products while selling them for quite a bit cheaper than the competition. Here&#8217;s a little piece from their about page:

> **Why buy TENDON?**  
> Lets make it simple. Tendon connectivity cables are higher quality.  
> All audio, video and computer cables that fall in the same category (5, 5e, 6, high-speed USB, fire wire, etc) all perform to the same standard. So why are you spending the additional 15% to 25% more on other brands of cable?  
> What makes Tendon cables better and why should we buy them? The only differences between our cables and theirs are:

From there, they describe the differences between TendonUSA cables and &#8220;theirs&#8221;. The &#8220;theirs&#8221; being Monster Cable and Belkin products of course. 

I&#8217;m hoping to get a few different types of cables from TendonUSA, all of which I will review here. I can&#8217;t really compare their performance to that of Monster Cable as I&#8217;ve never owned a Monster Cable product. I do have some friends with Monster Cable products for their Hi-Def setups. I plan on purchasing my first Hi-Def television later this month. Perhaps I can talk one of them into loaning me their Monster Cables for some testing. Cuz I sure as hell can&#8217;t go out and purchase a $150+ cable for testing purposes. ðŸ™‚ As for Belkin, the only product of theirs I&#8217;ve really used are their USB 2.0 cables, and their performance was matched by many generic USB 2.0 cables.

I can&#8217;t really say much more about TendonUSA and their products until I actually try them out. One thing I can say with 100% certainty though is all their products look very sleek and sexy, all look to be very well designed. Hopefully TendonUSA cables live up to consumers performance expectations. I&#8217;d love to see more competition in the high quality cable market, it&#8217;d drive prices down and would probably bolster the market as a whole. It&#8217;d open the market up to people who won&#8217;t pay ~$30 for a simple USB 2.0 cable.

Anyway, I&#8217;ll post reviews once I&#8217;ve spent a little time with the products. If you&#8217;ve ever used any TendonUSA products, I&#8217;d love to hear your experiences. From what little exposure I&#8217;ve had to TendonUSA, they seem to be a very honest, enthusiastic, no B.S. sort of company. I&#8217;m guessing their products will all be top-notch, I just have to wait and see.
