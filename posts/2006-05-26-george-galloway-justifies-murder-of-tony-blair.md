Bush and Blair have decided to &#8220;[Concede Missteps on Iraq][1].&#8221; [Hot Air][2] has a video of the news conference.

> In a joint news conference, Bush said he had used inappropriate &#8220;tough talk&#8221; &#8212; such as saying &#8220;bring &#8217;em on&#8221; in reference to insurgents &#8212; that he said &#8220;sent the wrong signal to people.&#8221; He also said the &#8220;biggest mistake&#8221; for the United States was the Abu Ghraib prison scandal, in which guards photographed themselves sexually tormenting Iraqi prisoners, spawning revulsion worldwide. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been paying for that for a long period of time,&#8221; he said.

[George Galloway used this][3] as an opportunity to attack Tony Blair, saying &#8220;it would be entirely logical and explicable&#8221; for him to die via suicide bomber. Galloway is obviously off his rocker. The fact that he even suggests a suicide bombing to kill Blair is sick. Let&#8217;s face it, suicide bombings are a pretty sleazy and cowardly way to take a life.

> The Respect MP George Galloway has said it would be morally justified for a suicide bomber to murder Tony Blair.
> 
> In an interview with GQ magazine, the reporter asked him: &#8220;Would the assassination of, say, Tony Blair by a suicide bomber &#8211; if there were no other casualties &#8211; be justified as revenge for the war on Iraq?&#8221;
> 
> Mr Galloway replied: &#8220;Yes, it would be morally justified. I am not calling for it &#8211; but if it happened it would be of a wholly different moral order to the events of 7/7. It would be entirely logical and explicable. And morally equivalent to ordering the deaths of thousands of innocent people in Iraq &#8211; as Blair did.&#8221;

Whose side are you on Galloway? Wait, I don&#8217;t think you should answer that. [Decision &#8217;08][4] asks a good question, &#8220;George Galloway: Human Or Snake?&#8221;

[Sister Toldjah][5] is wondering if Galloway can be censured in front of the Parliament for his remarks. I would certainly think so, wether any action is actually taken against Galloway is probably up for debate.

[Cold Fury dropped a great analogy][6] in their Galloway post:

> Listening to Leftard hero/terrorist-loving blowhard George Galloway talk about ethics and morals is roughly akin to listening to Ronald McDonald opine about fine wines and filet mignon.
