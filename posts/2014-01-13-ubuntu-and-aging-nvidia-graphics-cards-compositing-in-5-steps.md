I&#8217;ve got a pretty old Nvidia Quadro FX 1400 video card in an older IBM that I use as my primary workstation at home. It only has 3GB of RAM, about 4TB of storage, and a dual core Intel Pentium 4 CPU at 3.60GHz. It&#8217;s plenty fast for my needs. I typically run [Sublime Text 3][1], a terminal window with a few tabs, and Chrome Beta with many tabs.

I also use Docky, I&#8217;d really like to find a good replacement for it, but that&#8217;s something for another post.

### 1. Install the 304 nvidia driver.

Just fire up Synaptic Package Manager and search for &#8220;nvidia&#8221;. It&#8217;ll list a lot of stuff, but install the **nvidia-304** and **nvidia-304-dev** packages. After installation is done, go to step 2.

### 2. Select the nvidia-304 driver.

Go to &#8220;Settings Manager&#8221;, then click &#8220;Additional Drivers&#8221;. Select the 304 driver, select the one labeled as &#8220;(proprietary, tested)&#8221;. Look at the screenshot for a detailed view.

### 3. Apply the nvidia-304 driver.

Click **Apply**, right below the driver list. Enter your password, and let it do it&#8217;s thing. It may take a while.

### 4. Generate _xorg.conf_.

Do this with &#8216;_sudo nvidia-xconfig_&#8216;. It&#8217;ll write a new file to _/etc/X11/xorg.conf_. It will also make a backup of an existing _xorg.conf_ if there&#8217;s one there to backup.

### 5. Reboot.

That&#8217;s it, you should have compositing working after a reboot.

**Be aware that updates can break all of this.** After applying almost 200 updates, it reverted me back to the nouveau driver. I had to go through these steps again to get back to the nvidia-304 driver.

It&#8217;s possible that step 1 isn&#8217;t necessary. I think the nvidia-304 driver would probably get installed when you do step 2. I didn&#8217;t try, though.

I&#8217;ve often downloaded drivers right from [nvidia.com][2], but was having a terrible time getting them to build this time. Instead, I just went with the nvidia drivers provided by, um, well, whoever provides them, I guess. Using the nvidia-304 driver found in the Ubuntu repositories seems to be working quite well, so I&#8217;ll probably never have to do the manual download from nvidia.com again.

This applies to Ubuntu 13.10 Saucy Salamander, and more specifically, [the Xubuntu flavor][3]. But, it should work on any of the various flavors of Ubuntu.

Did I mess anything up? If so, please leave a comment here, or you can leave a comment on the [Hacker News thread][4].
