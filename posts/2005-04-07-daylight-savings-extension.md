Congress has added an amendment to the [Energy Bill][1] to extend daylight-savings time by two months. This would supposedly allow us to save 10,000 barrells of oil every day. Seems like a stupid idea to me&#8230;wouldn&#8217;t a whole bunch of code need updated in about every known application?

Everybody should use GMT, all the time. I know the Iowa House had a vote on wether or not to keep daylight savings in Iowa. I believe the vote was to keep daylight savings. At least there&#8217;s some people out there that are trying to get rid of it.

While we&#8217;re on the topic of Iowa, our reps at the capitol voted 51-49 to raise the speed limits on Iowa highways to 70 from 65. Along with that comes a pretty big fine increase for speeders. I&#8217;m just glad they finally decided to raise the speed limit. Now if we could only ticket people who constanly drive in the left lane. I heard that California is exploring some options for punishing slow drivers who are always in the left lane.
