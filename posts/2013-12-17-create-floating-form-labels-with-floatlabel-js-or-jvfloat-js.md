Floating labels are cool. People tend to have pretty strong opinions about floating labels, but overall, I like the idea, and have liked most implementations I&#8217;ve seen. The first one I saw [was on CodePen][1]. There&#8217;s [a good article @mds][2] on how the design pattern got started. There&#8217;s a lot of other cool thoughts on floating labels, specifically how they enhance (or undermine) the end user&#8217;s experience.

## Where It Started

The Floating Labels pattern was based on a [concept by Matt D. Smith][3]. You can read more about the history of the floating label pattern [at this blog post][4].  
[<img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.longren.org/images/float_pattern.gif?resize=600%2C400" alt="Original from Matt D. Smith" width="600" height="400" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11111111111111" data-recalc-dims="1" />][5]  
A [search for &#8220;floating labels&#8221; on CodePen][6] return about 200 results. You could probably take code from any of those pens and use it to implement a possibly slimmer floating label pattern for yourself. But, how can you choose which is the best way to do floating labels?

## I Like Plugins

Personally, I like to roll with jQuery plugins for this sort of thing. The smaller the plugin, the better.  
[<img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/longren.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/jvfloat.png?resize=603%2C159&#038;ssl=1" alt="jvfloat" width="603" height="159" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4984" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.longren.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/jvfloat.png?w=603&ssl=1 603w, https://i1.wp.com/www.longren.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/jvfloat.png?resize=300%2C79&ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 603px) 100vw, 603px" data-recalc-dims="1" />][7]  
I&#8217;ve used [JVFloat][8] and really like it. Super easy to implement and the styling is extremely minimal by default, which is a good thing. The default looks decent with pretty much any UI but can easily be modified via CSS.

[FloatLabel.js][9] is similar to JVFloat. The CSS that comes with FloatLabel.js is also extremely minimal and can be easily customized to fit your UI. I am going to be using FLoatLabel.js in future projects, like [kegplan.io][10].

## Responsive Ready?

FloatLabel.js appears to have better responsive support. In JVFloat, the floated labels and their respective input fields are really scrunched together, in the default CSS at least.  
[<img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/longren.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Screenshot-12172013-055950-PM-242x300.png?resize=242%2C300&#038;ssl=1" alt="FloatLabel.js" width="242" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4980" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.longren.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Screenshot-12172013-055950-PM.png?resize=242%2C300&ssl=1 242w, https://i0.wp.com/www.longren.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Screenshot-12172013-055950-PM.png?w=398&ssl=1 398w" sizes="(max-width: 242px) 100vw, 242px" data-recalc-dims="1" />][11]I haven&#8217;t witnessed this problem with FloatLabel.js. [Check out the FloatLabel.js demo][12] to see how it responds when you resize your browser window. Now have a look at the JVFloat demo, and again, resize your browser window to see how it responds. JVFloat.js doesn&#8217;t look as good as FloatLabel.js, it&#8217;s that simple.

So, if you&#8217;re looking for a good floating labels plugin I&#8217;d suggest [FloatLabel.js][9], as it&#8217;s more responsive-friendly than [JVFloat][8]. Both are great jQuery plugins, though. And one bonus is that JVFloat is also a [Zepto][13] plugin.

## Installation, finally!

Both are extremely easy to implement on your site. Just include the js and css like you usually would. But here&#8217;s more detail.

### JVFloat.js

  1. Upload CSS and JS files.
  2. Add <span class="lang:default decode:true  crayon-inline " ><link rel=&#8221;stylesheet&#8221; href=&#8221;css/jvfloat.css&#8221;></span> to your <span class="lang:default decode:true  crayon-inline " ><head></span> section.
  3. Add <span class="lang:default decode:true  crayon-inline " ><script src=&#8221;js/jvfloat.min.js&#8221;></script></span> right before the closing <span class="lang:default decode:true  crayon-inline " ></body></span> tag. Be sure you&#8217;ve loaded jQuery (or Zepto) first.
  4. Initialize JVFloat somewhere in your javascript (or on page directly in script tags) <span class="lang:default decode:true  crayon-inline " >$(&#8216;.float&#8217;).jvFloat();</span> 
  5. Add <span class="lang:default decode:true  crayon-inline " >class=&#8221;float&#8221;</span> to text input fields you wish to have floating labels.

### FloatLabel.js

FloatingLabels.js is probably quite similar. Since I&#8217;ve never used it, I won&#8217;t give you step-by-step directions since I have no experience with it (yet). Instead, refer to the [README file][14] at the [FLoatLabel.js GitHub repo][15]. It has installation instructions, I just haven&#8217;t tested them quite yet.

I really suggest you [read this post from Brad Frost][16] before voting. He gives some very good, specific examples of pros and cons of floating labels.

**Update December 30, 2013:** Also, check out [Label Better][18], by Pete R. It looks really nice and easy to setup and integrate. You can find [a demo over here][19].
