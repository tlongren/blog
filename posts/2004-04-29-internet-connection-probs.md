I&#8217;ve been having some issues with my internet connection for the past couple of days. It&#8217;s been going down for about 30 seconds every 15-20 minutes.

I&#8217;ve been having a discussion about this with a Mediacom tech support guy at the dlsreports.com forums. He suggested that the problem might be my nic, but I&#8217;ve come to the conclusion that that&#8217;s not the case. I swapped out nics and the problem persisted.

I really hope they get this resolved soon, continually losing connections while downloading is never good.
