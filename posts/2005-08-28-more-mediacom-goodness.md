Maybe Mediacom didn&#8217;t pay them enough money to rank well, I dunno. I have heard that J.D. Power gives top honors in each class to the company that &#8220;donates&#8221; the most money to them. That&#8217;s not the topic of this post though.

Mediacom recieved [the worst customer service rating][1] out of all the cable companies. I am so proud of Mediacom. I&#8217;m really getting tired of their crap again. My speeds are great, I&#8217;m not complaining about that. TV works great too.

But, remember 90+ days back when I started the Mediacom countdown to the free upgrades? Yah, well the 90 days has come and gone, and there&#8217;s still no 10000/1000 package. All we have is 5000/256. A 10/1 package was promised within 90 days. I want to know if they actually expected to be able to hit that 90 day deadline. I mean, it was printed in newspapers all over, saying that a 10/1 package would be available within 90 days. Bullshit. They can&#8217;t even provide a steady 5Mbps down to a lot of subscribers.

And we&#8217;re still stuck on 256Kbps upload. And they&#8217;re supposed to be coming out with phone service (VOIP). Correct me if I&#8217;m wrong, but won&#8217;t the VOIP suck up almost all of the upload? What happens when you try to surf the internet while on your phone? The sound quality can&#8217;t be too great.

There&#8217;s rumors going around that Mediacom is moving all of their equipment from analog to digital. This should help. But it doesn&#8217;t change that fact that promises were again made and again they weren&#8217;t kept.

I just wish they&#8217;d be straight with us for once. Although, Marshalltown, in Iowa, is getting a 10Mbps service soon, like within weeks. That package is only going to be $10 more than I&#8217;m paying. And I get half the download speed and a quarter of the upload speed. I hope it comes this way soon.

Honestly though, I am very happy with my internet service, although at least 512Kbps upload would be excellent. I do get a steady 5Mbps down at any given time of the day. When I signed up I had 1.5, then got a free upgrade to 3, and another free upgrade to 5. When we got the 3Mbps down upgrade we also got an upload increase to 256Kbps, from 128. All free upgrades, so I&#8217;m happy.
