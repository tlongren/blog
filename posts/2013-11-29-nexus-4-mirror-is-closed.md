If you&#8217;re seeing this post, chances are good that you&#8217;re looking for the Nexus 4 mirror that used to be at nexus4.longren.org. After running nexus4.longren.org for a year or so, I&#8217;ve decided to close it down. The development around Nexus 4 software is starting to slow down now that the Nexus 5 is available. I&#8217;m still using my Nexus 4 but will likely be getting the Nexus 5 within a month or so. As such, I don&#8217;t have a great interest in custom Nexus 4 software, as I once did.

It doesn&#8217;t make much sense for me to commit so many resources to something I don&#8217;t really use any longer, so, a few weeks ago I posted an announcement on nexus4.longren.org noting that I&#8217;d be closing the site down on November 22nd, 2013. I didn&#8217;t close it down until late on the 22nd, and closed it down simply by using a 301 redirect via a .htaccess file.

Right after I closed it down, you probably started being redirected to 404&#8217;s at this site. This post is here to prevent that, as all traffic going to nexus4.longren.org will be redirected to this post to help inform everyone about why the site went away.

In all, about 120,000 downloads were made, but I didn&#8217;t start tracking that until about half-way through the life of the site. The gapps mirror from Michael Banks was by far the most popular. I almost renamed the site to &#8220;Banks Gapps Mirror&#8221; at one point.
