After [making this post][1], I submitted a support ticket to [Dreamhost][2]. Justin at Dreamhost replied back with a pretty solid sounding solution:

> I did notice a few busy sites on the apaches for 2 of your domains. I started a move to another IP/apache which should complete in a few hours, and we can see if that apache turns out to be more stable. Since the server-status page for the old 2 showed an uptime of about 1 hour, likely the sites were causing that apache instance to time out and need to be restarted, resulting in a bit of downtime. Give it a try for a day and if you still have problems, let me know!

Perfect. Switch my domains over to a new httpd process with less activity. Makes sense. Well, after that was done, not much of an improvement was seen, as you can probably tell.

Today, I received another email from Justin saying he noticed longren.org was still slow to respond. He offered to move me to another server, assuming I was willing to have some downtime. He even asked if there was a time I&#8217;d prefer the move to be made. I asked him if 10:00 PST would work, and it did. So, this site is going to be offline for a few hours tonight while it&#8217;s being moved to a new server. The actual switch won&#8217;t take very long, I&#8217;ll just have to wait a few hours for the DNS to start pointing to the new IP.

Hopefully everything will be up and running along nice and smoothly tomorrow morning. Also, Justin at Dreamhost is awesome. He&#8217;s been very attentive and always offers possible solutions. Thanks again Justin!
