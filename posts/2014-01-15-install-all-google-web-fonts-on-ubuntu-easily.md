There&#8217;s a few different ways to install the Google Web fonts on your Ubuntu system. [Web UPD8 provides a script][1] that does it for you.

Another way is to use TypeCatcher, as [suggested by Jack Wallen at TechRepublic][2]. You can install TypeCatcher via a PPA, which means easy updates. No auto-updates with the script method, unfortunately.

To install TypeCatcher via PPA, open a terminal and run `sudo add-apt-repository ppa:andrewsomething/typecatcher` and then run `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install typecatcher`. That&#8217;s it, TypeCatcher should show up in your applications menu. If you&#8217;re using Xubuntu, it&#8217;s under Accessories.

I&#8217;d never heard of [TypeCatcher][3] until I came across Jack&#8217;s post at TechRepublic. Installed it on Xubuntu 13.10 and fell in love with it. Just select a font, and click the install button, done. The featured image for this post is TypeCatcher with the Lato font selected. For more details on TypeCatcher, [go read Jack&#8217;s post][2].

If you can&#8217;t use a PPA, or don&#8217;t want to, you&#8217;ve still got a good option for easily installing the fonts with the script from Web UPD8. If you&#8217;d like to see how the script works, you can find it below orÂ [download it here][4]. It essentially just using [Mercurial][5] to install them.

echo "Connecting to Github server..."
wget $_wgeturl -O $_gf.tar.gz

echo "Extracting the downloaded archive..."
tar -xf $_gf.tar.gz

echo "Creating the /usr/share/fonts/truetype/$_gf folder"

echo "Installing all .ttf fonts in /usr/share/fonts/truetype/$_gf"
find $PWD/fonts-master/ -name "*.ttf" -exec sudo install -m644 {} /usr/share/fonts/truetype/google-fonts/ ; || return 1

echo "Updating the font cache"
fc-cache -f > /dev/null

# clean up, but only the .tar.gz, the user may need the folder
rm -f $_gf.tar.gz

echo "Done."</pre>

For instructions on how to install the script from Web UPD8, head over to their [post about it][1], everything you need [will be there][1]. See? I just linked it twice for ya.
