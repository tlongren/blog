So, this world geography teacher in Colorado, [Jay Bennish][1], thinks it&#8217;s his job to tell his students how shitty of a job the Bush administration is doing and how America is inherently evil.&nbsp; A 16-year-old student named Sean Allen recorded one of Jay&#8217;s leftist rants and got the man suspended.&nbsp; My hat&#8217;s off to Sean, nice work.

This story got a little more interesting today as [100 students apparently walked out][2] over Jay Bennish&#8217;s suspension.&nbsp; This leads me to wonder if these 100 students even know what the job of a teacher is.&nbsp; A teacher is NOT a political activist.&nbsp; It&#8217;s his job to give facts as they are, not as he wishes they&#8217;d be.&nbsp; In addition to that, what the fuck does the Bush administration have to do with world geography?  
<!--adsense#ypn-->

  
Jay&#8217;s probably just smoked himself retarded.&nbsp; You can&#8217;t really blame him though.&nbsp; It&#8217;s gotta be a pretty miserable life ranting to 15 and 16 year old kids about how shitty the Bush administration is doing.&nbsp; The only people willing to listen to psycho-babble like that are other moonbats or un-educated students, like we have in this case.&nbsp; You should have been a blogger instead of a teacher Jay.&nbsp; May have proven to been a more lucrative career in the end.

[Slapstick Politics][3] has some more on this, along with pictures and links to the audio.&nbsp; They&#8217;ve got one picture of a girl with duct-tape over her mouth that reads &#8220;let me be heard&#8221;.&nbsp; She really looks like your typical dumb girl that believes in something because her friends do.&nbsp; Nobody&#8217;s silencing her, except for the duct-tape over her mouth.&nbsp; You poor little under-appreciated, un-heard, little bitch.&nbsp; I&#8217;m a huge free-speech supporter.&nbsp; However, a public school isn&#8217;t a place for a teacher to be practicing free speech.&nbsp; A public school is a place for teachers to give students facts about the world around them.

[Expose The Left][4] has an MP3 of the audio recorded by student Sean Allen.

**UPDATE:** Now [Stop the ACLU][5] is reporting that Jay Bennish has hired an ACLU attorney. Who&#8217;s the attorney you may ask? David Lane of course, the fine man Ward Churchill had defending him.

Post linked at [Mudville Gazette][6], thanks guys!
