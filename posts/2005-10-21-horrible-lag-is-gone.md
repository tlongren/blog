This site had been experiencing horrible lag over the last few days. I sat down lastnight and got it all figured out. First, I thought it must somehow be related to the new apache httpd server I installed, not the case. After determining that it wasn&#8217;t an apache config problem or something, I started into WordPress. The lag didn&#8217;t come from WordPress itself, but a plugin I was using. Said plugin was [wp-shortstat][1].

After disabling wp-shortstat, the page loads much quicker without the lag when loading the end of the page. It&#8217;s almost like my web server would get to the bottom of the page and then just stop sending the rest of the data to the browser. The browser would get to the very end of the page and just stop loading. If I&#8217;d view the rendered HTML in IE or FireFox, the the trailing &#8220;body&#8221; and &#8220;html&#8221; tags would be missing. It&#8217;s all better now though.

I also downloaded [Flock][2] lastnight at home. It&#8217;s pretty interesting, all sorts of feature for blogs and other services like [del.icio.us][3]. Flock is built on FireFox 1.0. And if you&#8217;d like a WordPress.com blog, download flock and you can get one [without an invite][4] (H/T [IO ERROR][5]).
