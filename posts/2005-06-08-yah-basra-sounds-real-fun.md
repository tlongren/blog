I saw this [on The Jawa Report][1] this morning. The city of Basra, Iraq&#8217;s second largest city and main seaport, declared itself open to foreign visitors. However, along with that, it suggested all foreign visitors &#8220;be vigilant, dress like locals and hire armed escorts&#8221;. According to Iraq&#8217;s head of tourism, after all that, there&#8217;s a 70% to 80% chance you&#8217;ll be OK.

Personally, I think I&#8217;d enjoy a little time there, by myself. I mean, how hard could it be to fit in? I have a darker skin tone than most whiteys I know. I can grow a wicked wild beard, one almost like Saddam had. And I have plenty of towels to serve as turbins. I dun know the language though, so that could pose a problem.

But really, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d choose to go there. The city itself sounds pretty shitty after all the fighting. Here&#8217;s a little quote from The Jawa Report.

> With the ever-present threats of kidnapping and assassination, Basra is surely a thrilling destination, however, tourists are cautioned that they will find the city&#8217;s &#8220;museums gutted, theatres shut, streets reeking with rubbish and sewage and waterways littered with capsized vessels, including Saddam Hussein&#8217;s yacht.&#8221;
