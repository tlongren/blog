The last few weeks there&#8217;s been many commercials airing, urging voters to turn down a proposed city-owned telecom bill. I was all for it, being that we don&#8217;t have many good options for internet service here in Iowa. This should provide some more options eventually for Iowans.

Voters in 17 Iowa cities voted for the proposal, allowing cities to build their own telecommunications companies. This will really piss off Mediacom.

> [DES MOINES, Iowa][1] &#8212; Voters in 17 cities are giving their local governments the right to form their own telecommunications company.
> 
> Supporters went to the polls Tuesday night and sent a message to companies like Mediacom and Qwest, which helped fund a $1 million campaign blitz against the measure.
> 
> Cities such as Dubuque, Mason City and Waterloo can now start their own cable, telephone and Internet systems and potentially charge less than other companies.

On the other hand, [15 cities voted against][2] the the proposal. One of those cities being Nevada, where I _usually_ reside. Nevada is currently served by Iowa Telecom for phone service, they&#8217;re our only option for non-voip phone service. Mediacom is the only cable provider. Both companies offer broadband, but Iowa Telecom&#8217;s is piss slow and Mediacom offers basically no upload speeds.

> Residents of 32 Iowa communities delivered a split verdict Tuesday on whether their cities should seek a role offering cable television, Internet and other telecommunications services.
> 
> Totals showed 17 communities passed the measures to form communications utilities and 15 defeated them. In the Des Moines metro area, proposals failed in Altoona, Carlisle, Norwalk and Windsor Heights.
> 
> &#8230;
> 
> The proposal was defeated in Nevada and six other communities served by telephone company Iowa Telecom. &#8220;I think it shows that (voters) just took the time to research the issue,&#8221; company spokesman Dan Eness said. &#8220;They realized a municipally owned telecommunications utility was not in the best interest for them.&#8221; 

OK Dan, you wouldn&#8217;t just say that simply because you&#8217;re an Iowa Telecom employee would you? Of course not. I should thank the Des Moines Register for getting thoughts from mostly Mediacom or Iowa Telecom employees, that&#8217;s super!
