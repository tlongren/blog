My family camps quite a bit. And we&#8217;re typically camping with friends. All of us have kids now, too, which makes everything a little more exciting.

One couple, in particular, are relatively new parents. Their daughter will be 2 years old in a few months. Prior to our first camping trip this year, they were concerned about their daughter running all around and getting lost.

She&#8217;s a really well behaved little girl, especially when her uncle Ty is with her. But every now and then, she gets this look in her eye, and you know she&#8217;s going to make a dash for the road, to head to the playground.

I had enough forethought to bring my Lunar Armbands along. On the second day of camping, a little before the sun started to set, I strapped a Lunar Armband on her leg and watched as she made a dash for the road (after I was sure no vehicles were around, of course). I was able to watch her walk all the way to the playground, and was able to see everything she did along the way, too (thanks to the still present sun).

Once she joined the mass of children at the playground, I started walking down so I&#8217;d be able to see her. I took a few steps out of our campsite and immediately saw the purple Lunar Armband strapped to her leg. I almost decided to stay at my campsite, just because I could see that she was safe, and was with the other kids who were camping with us.

She&#8217;s a pretty fun kid though, so I went down to the playground to mess around anyway. Pretty sure she thinks that my daughter, Sydney, is her big sister. Which is totally OK, because Syd needs to get used to having a little sister.
