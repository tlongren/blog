Rick Moran, at [Right Wing Nuthouse][1], has a [beautiful post on Able Danger][2] and why we&#8217;ll never know the entire truth.

For those who don&#8217;t know about Able Danger, I&#8217;ll summarize. Lt. Col. Anthony Shaffer says he alerted the FBI in 2000 about possible al Qaeda operatives operating in the U.S. prior to 9/11. The information he brought to the FBI was uncovered by a secret military unit called &#8220;Able Danger&#8221;. Shaffer also alleges that Able Danger identified Mohamed Atta as an al Qaeda operative within U.S. borders. This information was supposedly developed using &#8220;open source&#8221;, public information.

Anyway, Rick basically thinks we&#8217;ll never know the truth because of the various government agencies involved. Namely the NSA.

Other blogs covering this include:  
[Captain&#8217;s Quarters][3]  
[Iowa Voice][4]  
[Mark in Mexico][5]  
[GOP Bloggers][6]  
[Blogs for Bush][7]  
[In The Bullpen][8]

Mark in Mexico has a good overall roundup of Able Danger. I just don&#8217;t feel like writing what everyone else has already written. And it&#8217;s my birthday. So screw it.
