I&#8217;m gonna clean up my blogroll tomorrow. If you wanna be included or want to be removed, just leave a comment or shoot me an e-mail. Gotta split some of those links into new categories. Getting sick and tired of the growing list, makes it too hard to find a specific link.

**UPDATE:** Probably not the best time to do this, but I&#8217;m using [Spam Karma 2][1] WordPress plugin now for spam protection. There&#8217;s tons of comment and trackback spam every morning when I get up, along with a bunch of referer spam. I&#8217;ve tested it a little and it seems to work alright. 

<div class="wpulike wpulike-default " >
  <div class="wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked">
    <button type="button"
					aria-label="Like Button"
					data-ulike-id="2030"
					data-ulike-nonce="2d6ed7bf8f"
					data-ulike-type="likeThis"
					data-ulike-template="wpulike-default"
					data-ulike-display-likers="0"
					data-ulike-disable-pophover="0"
					class="wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_likethis_2030"></button><span class="count-box"></span>
  </div>
