I just uploaded a new version of [Unwakeable][1], version 1.5.3 rc1. This new version works with WordPress 2.7.1, unlike the previous version of Unwakeable.

Unwakeable 1.5.3 rc1 is up-to-date with [K2 r776][2]. K2 no longer includes the [K2 Sidebar Manager][3]. If you were using K2 Sidebar Modules and want to continue using it, you can [download the plugin here][4].  
[ad]  
There&#8217;s a new option on the Unwakeable Options page that allows you to customize top and bottom meta information for each post. The top meta information will be displayed directly under the title of a post. The bottom meta information will be displayed at the end of the posts content. You can use the following keywords to define what information you want to show: %author%, %categories%, %comments%, %date%, %tags% and %time%.

Have a look below to see what to enter in the top meta and bottom meta sections to display the same information that&#8217;s being displayed here.  
Top Meta: Published by %author% on %date% at %time% %comments%  
Bottom Meta: Categories: %categories% %tags%

You can download Unwakeable 1.5.3 rc1 from the [Unwakeable page][1], or [click here][5] to download it directly.
