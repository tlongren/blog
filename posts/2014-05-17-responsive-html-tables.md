## Responsive HTML Tables with TableSaw {.subtitle}

HTML tables have fallen out of favor over the past few years. People seem to use grids where a plain HTML table would really work much better. This is especially true when displaying data, like you&#8217;d find in a spreadsheet.

Enter [TableSaw][1], a group of plugins for **responsive tables**. There are various modes, the featured image for this post is a preview of the **Stack** mode.

There are many other modes to choose from, too.

To get you started quickly, there&#8217;s a **Stack-Only TableSaw**, it&#8217;s [barebones and doesn&#8217;t include the other modes][2]. Here&#8217;s [a demo of the Stack-Only TableSaw][3].

For usage instructions for the full TableSaw, [look towards the bottom of the README on GitHub][4]. You basically are just including a few CSS and JavaScript files.

<div class="wpulike wpulike-default " >
  <div class="wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked">
    <button type="button"
					aria-label="Like Button"
					data-ulike-id="6900"
					data-ulike-nonce="ddcd4e1d2a"
					data-ulike-type="likeThis"
					data-ulike-template="wpulike-default"
					data-ulike-display-likers="0"
					data-ulike-disable-pophover="0"
					class="wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_likethis_6900"></button><span class="count-box"></span>
  </div>
</div>
