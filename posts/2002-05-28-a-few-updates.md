The &#8220;Distributions&#8221; section is now functional. This is in the &#8220;Linux&#8221; area.

Also, check out my web servers uptime. It&#8217;s in the &#8220;System Status&#8221; section of the &#8220;Information&#8221; area. It&#8217;s getting pretty high.

I&#8217;ve also started using that horribly slow external modem. I found some drivers at the USR website. After I installed the drivers, I connected at 115kbps! It didn&#8217;t perfom any better than a 36.0kbps connection though. Now I can usually connect at 36.0kbps, which isn&#8217;t too bad for me. With the old pci modem that died, I&#8217;d usually get 38.6kbps.
