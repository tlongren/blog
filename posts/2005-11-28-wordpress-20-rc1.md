[WordPress 2.0 Release Candidate 1][1] is here. I don&#8217;t have any official links or anything, I haven&#8217;t even seen a mention of it on the mailing list. We&#8217;ve had one WordPress 2.0 test release each week for the last [three][2] [weeks][3] now. I like it. Only way I know of to grab it [is via subversion][4].

I&#8217;ve noticed something weird in 2.0 Beta 2 though. It may have been there in Beta 1 also, may still be in RC1, who knows. None of my tags show up on Technorati or anywhere. And I also noticed there&#8217;s no data in the &#8220;wp\_postmeta&#8221; table relating to the freshly published post, like there should be. So, after publishing the post, I&#8217;m taken back to the &#8220;write post&#8221; page. Only, the &#8220;write post&#8221; page doesn&#8217;t finish loading for a couple minutes sometimes. Previously, I had just navigated away from the loading page without giving it a second thought. I decided to wait for it to finish tonight. After loading, all the tags I had set for that post were in their proper places in the &#8220;wp\_postmeta&#8221; table.

There were some pretty odd circumstances with that post though. For one, I set the posts date/time to about 3 minutes out from where I currently was. After I published the article, it took about 3 minutes to show up here. That behavior is totally expected though. WordPress is good like that.

Also, there were some values in &#8220;wp\_postmeta&#8221; I had never seen before. I didn&#8217;t write em down, if I seem it again soon I&#8217;ll make a note. All I know is the &#8220;meta\_key&#8221; value was set to something like &#8220;\_ping\_me&#8221; or something similar to that. After the post had published, the unknown &#8220;meta_key&#8221; value had been deleted and my tags were in their proper place in that table.

Now, I don&#8217;t know if this behavior is always there when post-dating a post, but it seemed like the ping services (in &#8220;wp_options&#8221; table) were actually being pinged while the &#8220;write post&#8221; page was loading right after I had published.

Who knows, maybe it&#8217;s all coincidence. Time will tell. Oh, and before I forget, PHP 5.1.0 broke WordPress and lots of stuff for me, and lots of others as well. Tried upgrading to [PHP 5.1.1][5] today, same broken shit. Pages load blank the first time around, second time they load perfectly. I&#8217;m sticking with 5.0.x for a while. Soon to be moving to [MySQL 5][6]. I&#8217;m pretty sure I don&#8217;t have to pay for MySQL 5, I gotta research that a little first. I assume I can because the .tar.bz2 source is [where it should be][7] on [dev.mysql.com][8].

OK, time to upgrade to WordPress 2.0 Release Candidate 1 before bed. I gotta say though, I love the new dashboard. It&#8217;s got a Web 2.0 feel to it, but nobody knows what Web 2.0 is. So, I&#8217;m gonna take a chance and say &#8220;I really dig the new half Web 2.0 WordPress.&#8221;

**UPDATE:** OK, all updated to 2.0-RC1 now. You should ignore everything above this update pretty much. The problem I spoke about earlier isn&#8217;t related to WordPress, don&#8217;t hold me to that though. I did some more testing before upgrading to 2.0-RC1. I think it&#8217;s some odd plugin functionality. I&#8217;ve been using [Jerome&#8217;s Keywords][9] for tagging. Every time I edit a post the tags get wiped. I know that&#8217;s the general problem. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s caused by the plugin or if it&#8217;s WordPress wiping out all the &#8220;custom fields&#8221;. Jerome&#8217;s Keywords stores its tag data in those &#8220;custom fields&#8221;, inside the &#8220;wp_postmeta&#8221; table.

You can [get WordPress 2.0-RC1][10] in the [nightly builds directory][11] on the wordpress.org server.
