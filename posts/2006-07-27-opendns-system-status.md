It looks like OpenDNS is about to launch a &#8220;System Status&#8221; section of their website. Check out <http://system.opendns.com/>. I don&#8217;t know if this page is supposed to be live to the public yet, but what the hell.

Once you navigate to that page, you&#8217;ll see a status summary of the OpenDNS network. It looks like there&#8217;s gonna be a &#8220;mini blog&#8221; type of thing there too, probably mostly for making updates about outages or other problems. The &#8220;Testing&#8221; link you see in the image below is what leads me to believe there&#8217;s gonna be a separate &#8220;status&#8221; blog on that page.  
[<img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/static.flickr.com/72/199856555_e3d8ecc2e7_m.jpg?resize=240%2C156" width="240" height="156" alt="OpenDNS_SystemStatus" data-recalc-dims="1" />][1]  
There&#8217;s [also a newer post][2] at the OpenDNS blog about how they learn about phishing sites. I think they made that post in part due to one of my earlier posts on OpenDNS. ðŸ™‚

And boy how I wish I lived in San Francisco (well, not really). OpenDNS is currently [looking for a Debian system administrator][3]. Personally though, I&#8217;ve touched Debian once or twice. I can&#8217;t imagine leaving my beloved Slackware.

Oh, and I found the [system.opendns.com][4] site via my WordPress dashboard. system.opendns.com was listed as an incoming link from Technorati.
