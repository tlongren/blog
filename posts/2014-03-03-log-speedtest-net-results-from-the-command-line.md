## For those who live in the command line as much as possible {.subtitle}

### Install speedtest-cli

[speedtest-cli][1] is a Python app that provides a command line interface for testing bandwidth using [speedtest.net][2]. Installation is simple. It should work on Linux and OS X.

### The Bash Scripts

There&#8217;s two scripts, `speedtest.sh` and `speedtest-simple.sh`. Pretty self-explanatory. Results from `speedtest.sh` are stored in **st_results** in the current working directory. `speedtest-simple.sh` results are stored in **st\_results\_simple**, also in the current working directory.

### speedtest.sh Results

Below are the results of two speedtests run with `speedtest.sh`, along with the sharing image URL.

You can get less verbose output by modifying the `speedtest-cli` flags. `speedtest-cli --simple --share` will produce very simple results that are a bit easier to read. Two tests with the `speedtest-simple.sh` script are below. Note the absolute crap speeds. Wonderful hotel wi-fi, hah!

It&#8217;s a very, very simple way of logging the speedtest.net results, but it&#8217;ll do for most situations. When I get some free time this week, I&#8217;m going to combine `speedtest.sh` and `speedtest-simple.sh` and make it accept a `--simple` argument to generate the simple log.

After that&#8217;s done, I&#8217;ll be dropping the results into a SQLite database. I&#8217;ve gotten pretty familiar with SQLite lately, so it shouldn&#8217;t be too difficult.

Once this stuff is logging to a SQLite databse, I&#8217;ll put it up on GitHub, I can&#8217;t be the only one who would love to run SQL queries against this sort of personalized bandwidth data.

**Update April 19, 2014:** [Updated the code in the GitHub Gist to include the date and time][3] of the speedtest.
