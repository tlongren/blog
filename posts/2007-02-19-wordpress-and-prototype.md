Lots of people have searching about wordpress and prototype.js and have been lading at my [post about Alex King&#8217;s Share This][1] plugin and prototype.js. At the time I made that post, I wasn&#8217;t aware of the wp\_enueque\_script() function in WordPress 2.1.

Making use of wp\_enqueue\_script will ensure that your script is only loaded once. It&#8217;s really handy, hopefully everyone that uses prototype in their theme or plugin will start using wp\_enqueue\_script to load the prototype.js file. To load prototype, you&#8217;d use wp\_enqueue\_script like so:

<pre>&lt;?php wp_enqueue_script(&#39;prototype&#39;); ?&gt;</pre>

Prototype isn&#8217;t the only script that can be loaded with wp\_enqueue\_script. Take a look in wp-includes/script-loader.php to see some of the other scripts that wp\_enqueue\_script can load by default. 

<div class="wpulike wpulike-default " >
  <div class="wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked">
    <button type="button"
					aria-label="Like Button"
					data-ulike-id="2310"
					data-ulike-nonce="04ced6d5bc"
					data-ulike-type="likeThis"
					data-ulike-template="wpulike-default"
					data-ulike-display-likers="0"
					data-ulike-disable-pophover="0"
					class="wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_likethis_2310"></button><span class="count-box"></span>
  </div>
</div>
