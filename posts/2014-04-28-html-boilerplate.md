I&#8217;ve been [using this for a boilerplate lately][1], it&#8217;s pretty nice, and not all that different from the piece of HTML I&#8217;ve had saved on Dropbox for the last 10 years.

It provides a bare, standards-compliant starting point for your websites, giving you just enough to get started, making it easy to add your own stuff in.

It&#8217;s available [under the MIT license][2], which is [GPL compatible][3], and [can be downloaded from GitHub][1].

There are a few things you may want to customize before you start writing a bunch of content, though. This is taken straight from [the README on GitHub][4]. Take these points into consideration, especially page titles, css includes, and javascript includes.

  * Document&#8217;s language
  * Meta description
  * Title
  * Favicon file
  * CSS includes
  * Javascript includes

<div class="wpulike wpulike-default " >
  <div class="wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked">
    <button type="button"
					aria-label="Like Button"
					data-ulike-id="6668"
					data-ulike-nonce="c394d64c48"
					data-ulike-type="likeThis"
					data-ulike-template="wpulike-default"
					data-ulike-display-likers="0"
