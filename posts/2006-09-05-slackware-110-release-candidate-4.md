[Slackware 11.0 Release Candidate 4][1] is out! This release sees kernel 2.4.33.3 included as the default. Soon after RC4 was made, Patrick made another small update to the [ChangeLog][2]:

> Sun Sep 3 19:59:47 CDT 2006  
> a/udev-097-i486-8.tgz: Fixed a missing &#8216;[&#8216; in rc.udev. Thanks to  
> guilherme for pointing out the error, and to J., who found the missing  
> &#8216;[&#8216;. (It had fallen off my desk and ended up under a table)  
> kernels/System.map: Forgot to gzip a bunch of these. Thanks, Steve&#8217;o.

This should definitely be the last RC before Slackware 11.0 final is released. In the past two or three Slackware releases (10.0, 10.1, and 10.2), we&#8217;ve only seen 2 or 3 release candidates. I suppose there&#8217;s a chance we&#8217;ll see RC5 this time, but I&#8217;m thinking this RC4 will be the last. Probably see Slackware 11.0 final within a week and a half or so.
