Joshua Sparling, who&#8217;s been at Walter Reed Army Medical Center recovering from a gunshot wound he got in Iraq, got a really special Christmas card the other day. The cards outside looked all patriotic and pretty. The text inside the card read &#8220;Have a great time in the war and have a great time dieing in the war&#8221; &#8220;P.S. DIE&#8221;. Sweet huh?

Can&#8217;t imagine how Mr. Sparling felt after getting a card like that. I don&#8217;t think I could resist hunting the &#8220;christmas death wishing&#8221; pig down and gutting him immediately. [Michelle Malkin][1] has a mailing address for Joshua Sparling if you want to send him a real Christmas blessing.

Another disgusting piece of news today too, involving my good buddy John Kerry. Kerry seems to think American soldiers in Iraq are the ones really spreading terror. [Captains Quarters][2] has a link to the full transcript, quoted below.

> SCHIEFFER: All right. Let me shift to another point of view, and it comes from another Democrat, Senator Joe Lieberman of Connecticut. He takes a very different view. He says basically we should stay the course because, he says, real progress is being made. He said this is a war between 27 million Iraqis who want freedom and 10,000 terrorists. He says we&#8217;re in a watershed transformation. What about that?
> 
> Sen. KERRY: Let me&#8211;I&#8211;first of all, there is so much more that unites Democrats than divides us. And Democrats have much more in common with each other than they do with George Bush&#8217;s policy right now. Now Joe Lieberman, I believe, also voted for the resolution which said the president needs to make more clear what he&#8217;s doing and set out benchmarks, and that the policy hasn&#8217;t been working. We all believe him when you say, \`Stay the course.&#8217; That&#8217;s the president&#8217;s policy, which hasn&#8217;t been changing, which is a policy of failure. I don&#8217;t agree with that. But I think what we need to do is recognize what we all agree on, which is you&#8217;ve got to begin to set benchmarks for accomplishment. You&#8217;ve got to begin to transfer authority to the Iraqis. And **there is no reason, Bob, that young American soldiers need to be going into the homes of Iraqis in the dead of night, terrorizing kids and children, you know, women, breaking sort of the customs of the&#8211;of&#8211;the historical customs, religious customs.** Whether you like it or not&#8230;
> 
> SCHIEFFER: Yeah.
> 
> Sen. KERRY: &#8230;Iraqis should be doing that. And after all of these two and a half years, with all of the talk of 210,000 people trained, there just is no excuse for not transferring more of that authority.

Wow, that&#8217;s some top-notch hippie-babble right there. Young american soldiers are &#8220;going into the homes of Iraqis in the dead of night, terrorizing kids and children&#8221;? What the fuck Kerry? He can&#8217;t pull much more shit than that outta his ass. Or maybe he can, can never tell what those hippie-liberal-douche-bag types are in to sexually. So, in all reality, he&#8217;s probably got a lot more room for a lot more shit.

You suck Kerry, we&#8217;d all be dead now if you&#8217;d been elected. heh. [The Political Teen][3] has video, unless the videos are down right now.
