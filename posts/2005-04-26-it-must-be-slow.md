It must be a slow news day or something already. I saw this on the news this morning before coming into work. But to find this on the &#8220;Top News&#8221; section on a site like [MyWay][1] is a little odd. It&#8217;s stupid really.

This year for the [Drake Relays][2] they chose a mascot, I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;ve done that in past years. They had a contest between 50 or so bulldogs. Tiberius emerged as the big winner. For a bulldog, he&#8217;s actually not bad looking, I typically don&#8217;t like those animals as they are ugly as hell.

But yah, it must be a really slow news day if this makes it to the top news. It&#8217;s starting to cool down again for the relays though. It had been in the 70&#8217;s the past few weeks, now it&#8217;s in the 50&#8217;s and will remain there for the remainder of the week. It just wouldn&#8217;t be the same Drake Relays without the cold, rainy weather.
