I removed the router lastnight. I made the web server (vectraxw) into the router. The previous router didn&#8217;t like to come up nicely after the power goes out. I think it was because of the SCSI raid card that&#8217;s in it. Anyway, vectraxw functions as the router/webserver/ftp server now.

I also upgraded the kernel on vectraxw to 2.4.20-pre6. I&#8217;ll probably upgrade it to -pre7 sometime today. Nightengale just got upgraded to -pre7.
