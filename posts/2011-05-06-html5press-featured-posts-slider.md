[HTML5Press][1] has been updated to include a featured post slider. You can view it in action at the [HTML5Press demo site][2].

There are two options associated with the featured post slider. The first option allows you to select which category you want to pull posts from. The second option lets you set the number of posts to include in the featured posts slider. Options there are 5, 10, 15, or 20.

If a featured post has a featured image associated with it, then that image will be displayed, along with contents of [the_excerpt()][3].

You can see a screenshot attached to this post if you don&#8217;t want to visit the [HTML5Press demo site][2].

To activate the featured posts slider, simply select which category you want to use and save the HTML5Press options. After doing that, the featured post slider will show on your front page. I may add an option later to select what page you want it to show on.

I haven&#8217;t released a new, stable version of HTML5Press yet that contains this feature. If you&#8217;d like to try it out though, you can [download HTML5Press 1.4-rc2 from Github][4].
