[Crossposted from Stop The ACLU][1]

> In conjunction with the Washington-based Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the ACLU has lobbied hard against Arab-profiling at airports for years. &#8220;Profiles are notoriously under-inclusive,&#8221; says ACLU legislative counsel Gregory Nojeim. &#8220;Who knows who the next terrorist will appear as? It could be a grandmother. It could be a student. We just don&#8217;t know.&#8221;[Source][2] 

> The airline industry&#8217;s fear of such lawsuits is based on solid historical precedent. In 1993, for instance, the ACLU joined forces with the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC) to sue Pan American World Airways for having detained a man of Iranian descent during the first Persian Gulf War.

So, the ACLU says political correctness trumps common sense. They block that route of securing ourselves from being blown up. What to do? Hmmm.. I&#8217;ve got it! Lets do random searches!

> [ACLU Files Suit Over Random Subway Searches.][3]The New York Civil Liberties Union (NYCLU), the New York chapter of the ACLU, has announced that they intend on filing a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in Manhattan today. The suit claims that the random bag searches before boarding the subway system is unconstitutional.

City lawyers have noted that an al-Qaida training manual advising terrorists to avoid police checkpoints gives the city [some justification for its random searches of bags][4] entering the subway system.

Ok, so the ACLU says no profiled searches, and no random searches. What about searches across the board? Nope. [Raymond James Stadium tried it, and the ACLU sued.][5] So, where does that leave us with searches? I think we can conclude that the ACLU are against all searches. Is this because they stand by the principle of the fourth amendment? The irony and hypocrisy here is that, [the NYCLU HQ has a sign warning visitors that all bags are subject to search.][6] Apparantly their war against searches is not based on principle. 

But searches are not the only that brings criticism on the ACLU on the topic of National Security.

[The ACLU and CAIR][7] have actually taken up quite a number of cases together. In 2003, the Ohio chapter of the ACLU awarded its yearly &#8220;Liberty Flame Award&#8221; to the Ohio chapter of CAIR &#8220;for contributions to  
the advancement and protection of civil liberties.&#8221; This same Ohio chapter, in August of this year, [refused contributions from the United Way][8], as to not complete a required counterterrorism compliance form.

But it isn&#8217;t isolated to one rouge chapter. 

> [In October of 2004][9], the ACLU turned down $1.15 million in funding from two of it&#8217;s most generous and loyal contributors, the Ford and Rockefeller foundations, saying new anti-terrorism restrictions demanded by the institutions make it unable to accept their funds.
> 
> &#8220;The Ford Foundation now bars recipients of its funds from engaging in any activity that &#8220;promotes violence, terrorism, bigotry, or the destruction of any state.&#8221;
> 
> The Rockefeller Foundation&#8217;s provisions state that recipients of its funds may not &#8220;directly or indirectly engage in, promote, or support other organizations or individuals who engage in or promote terrorist activity.

What is this all about? 

> Although its website proclaims that it does not receive &#8220;any government funding,&#8221; it does get money from a program that allows federal employees to make charitable contributions through payroll deductions. Last year it got $470,000 from the program. (The ACLU&#8217;s 2002 annual budget, the most recent available, was $102 million.)
> 
> Now it had a choice: give up the money, or sign a promise certifying that the ACLU &#8220;does not knowingly employ individuals or contribute funds to organizations found on&#8221; government watch lists of suspected supporters of terrorism.
> 
> Trouble was, the ACLU had strongly opposed the lists, saying they were often inaccurate and violated the constitutional rights of some people.
> 
> But it really hated the idea of giving up the money.[Source][10]

So what did they do? Well, at first they decided they would try to trick the government. They decided to keep the money, AND keep hiring anyone they pleased, by what Nadine Strossen called a &#8220;clever interpretation.&#8221; Their solution was that if they remained ignorant of who was on the list, then they couldn&#8217;t &#8220;knowingly&#8221; hire anyone on the list. Anthony D. Romero, the ACLU&#8217;s executive director, tells the New York Times: &#8220;I&#8217;ve printed [the lists] out. I&#8217;ve never consulted them.&#8221;

To make a long story short, when The New York Times outted them, they caved in. But they didn&#8217;t cave in to the government, they just decided to forgoe the money, so they could still ignorantly hire people on the government watchlist. Isn&#8217;t that nice?

However, this isn&#8217;t the end. [The American Civil Liberties Union and 12 other national non-profit organizations][11] successfully challenged Office of Personnel Management&#8217;s Combined Federal Campaign (CFC) requirements that all participating charities check their employees and expenditures against several government watch lists for &#8220;terrorist activities&#8221; and that organizations certify that they do not contribute funds to organizations on those lists. This is something the ACLU finds worthy of celebrating. In my opinion this is reason to be suspicious of what the ACLU does with its funds.

It isn&#8217;t a far fetched idea to wonder if the ACLU uses its funds to support terrorism. [The ACLU&#8217;s history is tainted][12] in this arena. 

> In 1985 Samuel L. Morrison, an employee of the Naval Intelligence Support Command was convicted and sentenced for stealing classified spy satellite photographs from his office, cutting off the &#8220;secret&#8221; designation and selling them to a foreign publication. The ACLU claimed that Morrison had the right to steal and sell these classified documents and the under the First Amendment.

> Positions like these might be easier to understand if we look at ACLU Policy #117. They title this policy &#8220;Controlling the Intelligence Agencies&#8221;. &#8221;
> 
> Limit the CIA, under the new name of the Foreign Intelligence Agency, to collecting and evaluating foreign intelligence information. Abolish all covert operations. Limit the FBI to criminal investigations by eliminating all COINTEL-PRO-type activity and all foreign and domestic intelligence investigations of groups or individuals unrelated to a specific criminal offense.
> 
> Prohibit entirely wiretaps, tapping of telecommunications and burglaries. Restrict mail openings, mail covers, inspection of bank records, and inspection of telephone records….&#8221;

[The ACLU Defends the P.L.O.][12]

> &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid even the good guys on civil liberties are going to be against us on this one.&#8221; Those are the words of ACLU Executive director Ira Glasser on the ACLU&#8217;s decision to represent an agent of Yassir Araftat&#8217;s Palestine Liberation Organization.  
> I wonder if his definition of &#8220;good guys&#8221; meant American citizens who care about their country and are not willing to grant sworn terrorists complete freedom within our borders. If so, he is absolutely correct. We are against that one.  
> &#8220;Arafat&#8217;s group of ruthless murderers had set up an &#8220;information office&#8221; in Washington D.C, only a few blocks from the White House.

[The ACLU Defends &#8220;Mad Dog&#8221; of Libya, Muammar Qaddafi.][13]

> &#8220;In 1985, the ACLU learned of an alleged plan by the CIA to engineer Qaddafi&#8217;s overthrow. Outraged, they put together a &#8220;strenuous&#8221; public protest against this proposed action.
> 
> In a letter fillled with self-righteous indignation, Morton Halperin, Director of the ACLU Washington office, expressed his opinion of that plan to Sen. David Durenberger, Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, with copies to everyone imaginable.
> 
> And to make sure no one was left out, the ACLU also issued a press release trumpeting it&#8217;s opposition to any attempt to oust Qaddafi.&#8221;

> The ACLU has also shown itself a willing tool of the terrorists, waging a massive anti-anti-terrorism legal campaign. This pillar of the legal Left denounced the government&#8217;s requirement that men aged 16-25 holding &#8220;temporary visas&#8221; from nations with known ties to terrorism register with the INS; represented Sami al-Arian, the North American fundraiser and co-founder of Palestinian Islamic Jihad (filing a brief upholding his inalienable right to fresh briefs!); rallied on behalf of convicted al-Qaeda benefactor Maher Mofeid Hawash; urged local communities not to cooperate with federal anti-terror investigations; and opposed the FBI&#8217;s monitoring Islamist mosques. As David Horowitz notes in his book Unholy Alliance, radical Center for Constitutional Rights lawyer Ron Kuby notes the &#8220;passionate…identification&#8221; most lawyers feel with their clients, such as that of convicted terror enabler Lynne Stewart for World Trade Center bomber Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman. Given her aid for international Islamic terrorism, the government is right to keep a watchful eye on those who perpetually side with the enemy. [Front Page Magazine][14]

[They have fought hard for the release of Abu Ghraib images][15] depicting sickening torture of our enemies, further inflaming the propaganda war on the side of the enemy. [The ACLU also submitted a 37-page report][16] to the United Nations Human Rights Committee describing specific U.S. breaches of the political and civil rights covenant.

The report included sections on &#8220;Excessive Government Secrecy&#8221;; &#8220;Racial Profiling of the U.S. Arab, South Asian, and Muslim Communities&#8221;; &#8220;Criminalization of Political Protest&#8221;; &#8220;Increased Surveillance Powers&#8221;; and &#8220;Random Searches.&#8221;

Recently the ACLU have decided to represent two detainees who claim the U.S. Military [threw them into lions dens.][17] Somebody is lion alright. They have also accused the U.S. military of [outright murdering 21 detainees.][18] They have even advised the majority of the prisoners at Gitmo that they [did not have to answer questions from military interrogators][19].

Actions like these have [enraged groups like The American Legion][20], and [Christians for Reviving American Values][21], who are asking Congress to investigate the ACLU. The American Legion is already [mobilizing its members][22] to fight the ACLU over issues such as the Boyscouts. The sympathy for the enemy also [has them fired up.][23] To many of these groups, and to many Americans, the perception is that [The ACLU cares more about terrorists than it does about America.][24]

As you can see, balancing national security interests with a respect for civil liberties is not the goal of the ACLU. Its goal is the absolute pursuit of civil liberties, without regard for its consequences. Gone are the the carefully worded policies that guided Union thinking during World War II. Gone, too is any kind of talk about the enemies of the United States. It is hard to imagine a person vile enought, or a crisis serious enough, to shake the ACLU from its absolutist position during wartime. The tragedy is it is not just the nation&#8217;s security that stands to lose as a result, it is the cause of liberty itself.
