Another American hostage (Paul Johnson) got his head whacked, this time in the house of Saud (Saudi Arabia). Before all of this ends, it&#8217;s gonna have to be us or them (them being islamic extremists). Either they let go of their extremest views on islam or we kill them. I&#8217;ve had the sense for a while now that we&#8217;re going to kill all of them, or they&#8217;re going to kill all of us. I&#8217;d say right now, the odds are in their favor.

On a lighter note, I finally got me a jizzob (job in non-ebonics)! I&#8217;ve gotta go in to Moms Meals for my first day on Monday at 8:00 am. I haven&#8217;t been up at 8:00 am for a very long time. I guess I have gone to sleep around then, but haven&#8217;t actually awoken from sleep that early for a long time.
