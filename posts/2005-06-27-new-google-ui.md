I just saw this over on [Search Engine Roundtable][1]. It appears Google is messing around with a new user interface. It basically looks the same with a few more items thrown in. First thing I noticed was the tabs at the top. Search Engine Roundtable [has links to a few forums][1] discussing the new UI. The [SEO UK blog][2] [has a screenshot][3] of the UI. SunnyMonkey (at SEO UK), has made a few notes on [his screenshot][4] to help you see the changes.

It&#8217;s nothing great but there&#8217;s a lot more color. I dunno if I like the color combo they chose. Too many different colored pastels. I dunno if I like the tabs. I think I like it how they have it more right now, just the plain text links. Oh well, they&#8217;re google and can do whatever the hell they want. 

<div class="wpulike wpulike-default " >
  <div class="wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked">
    <button type="button"
					aria-label="Like Button"
					data-ulike-id="1930"
					data-ulike-nonce="a0a09d678c"
					data-ulike-type="likeThis"
					data-ulike-template="wpulike-default"
					data-ulike-display-likers="0"
					data-ulike-disable-pophover="0"
					class="wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_likethis_1930"></button><span class="count-box"></span>
