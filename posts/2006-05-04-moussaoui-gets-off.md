A jury decided yesterday that Zacarias Moussaoui doesn&#8217;t deserve death for the hand he played in the 9/11 attacks. How the fuck did they come to that conclusion? They [should have killed him][1].

The jurors [deliberated for 41 hours][2] over a seven day period before they came to the life sentence verdict. Quite the waste of time I&#8217;d say. I really can&#8217;t understand how these jurors decided to not kill this guy off.

This guy played a hand in killing 3000+ people. There&#8217;s people sitting on death-row right now that have committed crimes far less heinous than those commited by Moussaoui. And some of those people are probably on death-row for crimes they didn&#8217;t commit. Moussaoui clearly played a role and he gets life in prison, not death. I&#8217;d say he got a pretty sweet deal.

But knowing these religious fanatic types, he&#8217;d rather die than be in prison for the rest of his life. So maybe life in prison is a better punishment for this guy. To give him death would be to let him off the hook.

Moussaoui&#8217;s mother is [blaming &#8220;racist american&#8221;][3] for the conviction of her son. How fucking silly is that? The dude had a goal of killing Americans. We have every right to convict him, and much worse really.

[James Joyner][4] made a really good point saying:

> &#8220;If Moussaoui doesnâ€™t deserve to die for his crimes, almost no one currently on death row does. Those who argue that the current system of capital punishment is arbitrary and capricious have much more ammunition now.&#8221;

There&#8217;s already been lots of coverage on this topic, so I&#8217;ll just throw you over to those who already have a good amount of content. [The Political Pit Bull][5] has a huge post with many updates including reaction from bloggers and quotes. [Stop the ACLU][6] has a nice round of quotes along with a whole bunch of related posts.

Also, [WizBang][7] notes &#8220;Moussaoui&#8217;s final outburst&#8221;.

> [ALEXANDRIA, Virginia (Reuters)][8] &#8211; A defiant Zacarias Moussaoui was sentenced to life in prison on Thursday, one day after a jury spared his life and rejected U.S. government arguments that the September 11 conspirator should be executed.
> 
> &#8220;God curse America,&#8221; Moussaoui shouted right before U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema imposed the sentence. &#8220;God save Osama bin Laden. You&#8217;ll never get him.&#8221;

heh, now that&#8217;s funny. Have a good ole time in federal-pound-me-in-the-ass-prison there Moussaoui. Maybe one day Osama will be able to wear your ass on his head as a turbin. After it&#8217;s all gaping and droopy and shit from the pounding of course&#8230;
