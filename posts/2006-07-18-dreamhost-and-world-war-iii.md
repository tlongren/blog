[The Dreamhost outage yesterday][1] is now resolved. [Four separate issues][2] all came to light at roughly the same time, taking a good portion of Dreamhosts services offline. I personally assumed the Dreamhost outage was due to the poor connectivity between Level3 and Internap lastnight. See this image:  
[<img src="https://i2.wp.com/static.flickr.com/62/192193055_1085da9107_m.jpg?w=1100" alt="Level3 to Internap" data-recalc-dims="1" />][3]

It doesn&#8217;t sound like the Dreamhost issues had anything to do with their connectivity providers, but I&#8217;m glad they&#8217;re back up and running. I wonder who Dreamhost gets their connections from, probably a few different providers.

[Is the Dreamhost outage the cause][4] for high search rankings of &#8220;World War III&#8221; on Technorati? No, but it is pretty amusing that Dreamhost is one of the top technorati searches. It somehow doesn&#8217;t fit in with the rest of the top searches: &#8220;World War III&#8221;, &#8220;Lebanon&#8221;, &#8220;Israel&#8221;, and of course, &#8220;Bush&#8221;. Where&#8217;s &#8220;Hezbollah&#8221;?? heh.
