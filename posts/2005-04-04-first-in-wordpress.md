This is my first post in WordPress. I got all my old posts converted over, still gotta do the comments. Still looking for a theme I wanna stick with too.

I like WP a lot so far, some really neat things can be done with it. There wasn&#8217;t an &#8220;option&#8221; field in one of it&#8217;s tables though for the gmt\_offset so it displays the correct time. I couldn&#8217;t figure out why the offset I enetered in the options page wouldn&#8217;t save. Adding a &#8220;gmt\_offset&#8221; option to the &#8220;wp_options&#8221; table seemed to fix it. It just didn&#8217;t have a place to be stored. Lucky guess for the options name I guess. ðŸ™‚
