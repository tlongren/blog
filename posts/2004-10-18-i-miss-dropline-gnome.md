I was an avid [Dropline Gnome][1] user. The most recent version of Dropline Gnome doesn&#8217;t work at all for me.

Nautilus (the desktop manager) doesn&#8217;t run. I&#8217;m not even sure if the problem is with Dropline Gnome, or my kernel.

Dropline Gnome 2.8 requires a 2.6.x kernel. When trying to start Gnome in a 2.6.x kernel, I get bunches of errors about /dev/dsp not existing (the sound device).

Now, either udev isn&#8217;t working (which is built into the kernel), or hal/dbus isn&#8217;t working. From what I&#8217;ve read, hal/dbus and udev do about the same thing. Pretty much a dynamic /dev filesystem.

Anyway, I&#8217;m frustrated, and somewhat angered. I&#8217;m not at all happy with the 2.6.x series of linux kernels. 2.4.x works wonderfully for me, 2.6.x has just been a pain. I want my Dropline Gnome desktop back, and I want it soon.

I&#8217;m going to buy a PC to replace my dual processor machine that died. The gateway I got from work isn&#8217;t that useful to me. The video card in it blows, and there&#8217;s no AGP slot for my Radeon card. The pc I&#8217;m looking at buying is pretty much exactly like my other dual processor machine. It&#8217;s got a VP6 motherboard, 2x 733mhz P3 procs, and 1.5gb of RAM. I didn&#8217;t have that much RAM. The guy is letting it go for $220. The RAM alone is almost worth that much. Hopefully I&#8217;ll be able to get Dropline and a 2.6.x kernel working better on that machine. I might even drag out that dead VP6 machine and see if I can&#8217;t get it working.
