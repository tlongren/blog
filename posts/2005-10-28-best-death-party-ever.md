I wrote a few days ago about Cindy Sheehan preparing to [tie herself to a fence][1] once the 2000th soldier in Iraq had died. Well, didn&#8217;t go exactly as she planned it would seem. [The Political Pitbull][2] has some pictures of lonely Cindy just sitting there playin with her blackberry. Sure doesn&#8217;t look like her 2000 deaths party was much of a success&#8230;

The [hippies in San Fran][3] seem to have had better success, if nothing else they had a good time. Really, [go look at them][3]. It looks like the set of a Cheech and Chong movie. Or as [Ace puts it][4], &#8220;a tailgate party outside a fucking Phish concert.&#8221;

[The Indepundit][5] has a link to [The Everlasting Phelps][6], who asks if you can tell the difference between these hippies in San Fran and partying White Sox fans. I sure can&#8217;t, there&#8217;s something seriously wrong there.

Thanks [Basil][7], [Don Surber][8], [The Jawa Report][9], [Mudville Gazette][10], [The Blue State Conservatives][11], and [Stop the ACLU][12] for providing me with much needed linkage. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d see much traffic were it not for those kind people&#8230;
