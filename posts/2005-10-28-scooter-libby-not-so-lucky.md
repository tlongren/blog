The [NYT][1] is reporting that Karl Rove, Bush&#8217;s deputy chief of staff and a senior advisor, won&#8217;t be indicted in the Plame case. He will remain under investigation though, lucky him.

Sooter Libby Jr., Dick Cheney&#8217;s chief of staff, will be indicted on charges of &#8220;making false statements to the grand jury in the C.I.A. leak inquiry&#8221;.

> WASHINGTON, Oct. 27 &#8211; Lawyers in the C.I.A. leak case said Thursday that they expected I. Lewis Libby Jr., Vice President Dick Cheney&#8217;s chief of staff, to be indicted on Friday, charged with making false statements to the grand jury.
> 
> Karl Rove, President Bush&#8217;s senior adviser and deputy chief of staff, will not be charged on Friday, but will remain under investigation, people briefed officially about the case said. As a result, they said, the special counsel in the case, Patrick J. Fitzgerald, was likely to extend the term of the federal grand jury beyond its scheduled expiration on Friday.
> 
> As rumors coursed through the capital, Mr. Fitzgerald gave no public signal of how he intended to proceed, further intensifying the anxiety that has gripped the White House and left partisans on both sides of the political aisle holding their breath.

Being indicted doesn&#8217;t mean guilty. Basically, the prosecutors feel they&#8217;ve got enough on Libby to link him to crimes he&#8217;s suspected of commiting. They just need more time before they&#8217;re confident enough in their evidence to indict Rove.

None of this is even known to be 100% true yet. It sounds very plausible though, along with a few thousand other possibilities. I almost hope it goes down that way. I expect aggression and general outrage from left leaning bloggers if Rove does &#8220;get lucky&#8221; and comes out still under investigation. Should be a good time.

This post kindly linked at [bRight & Early][2], [The Political Teen][3], [Cao&#8217;s Blog][4], [MacStansbury][5], [Jo&#8217;s Cafe][6], [Adam&#8217;s Blog][7], and [NIF][8]. Also linked at [Real Teen][9], who&#8217;s hosting his first true open trackback party.

**UPDATE 1:** [ABC news][10] has picked this up now too. h/t [Dan @ Riehl World View][11].

**UPDATE 2:** [NBC News][12] is confirming (along with [WaPo][13] now) that Libby will be indicted today while Rove will remain under investigation. h/t [Real Teen][14].

[James Joyner of OTB][15] notices that most news sources are reporting on the non-indictment of Rove rather than the indicement of Libby. Sounds like the liberal media trying to ruffle feathers again. [Conservative Cat][16] gets serious about Plamegate and looks at how cats would make better military leaders than humans, sort of.

**UPDATE 3:** I caught Patrick Fitzgerald explaining all the charges in a [press conference][17] while I was at lunch. [The Political Teen][18] has the video. I think Fitzgerald did a nice job explaining everything and why Libby is being indicted. The Q&A was basically worthless, Fitzy didn&#8217;t really answer much. It&#8217;s not his fault reporters ask questions they already know the answers to though, or non-answers in this case.

And Bush is supposed to speak about the Libby indictment [at 3:50 PM ET][19]. So in like 2 minutes.
