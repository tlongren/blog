## Features a visual drag & drop page builder that will let your users create countless pages at a drop of a dime {.subtitle}

Got an email from Olga at [ThemeFuse][1] yesterday announcing the release of their new drag & drop WordPress framework named [Unyson][2].

Unyson comes with many built-in extensions, and [the documentation][3] seems to be very helpful and complete. Some highlights from the [Unyson home page][2]:

  * All the built in extensions & options work in perfect harmony. Youâ€™ll find developing on Unyson a breeze.
  * Your users will love the drag and drop page builder and the customization options built into
  * All you need to do is download the Unyson WordPress framework and start developing your theme.
  * We have a lot of tools ready to help you along the way: developer manual, Trello, GitHub Support and more.

Unyson also includes an extensive list of customizations and options:

  * Page Builder
  * Option Types
  * Styling
  * Sidebars
  * Megamenu
  * Backup
  * Sliders
  * SEO
  * Breadcrumbs
  * Portfolio
  * Custom Widgets

I enjoy this theme so much because it has many features that premium or paid themes have, but [Unyson][2] is free! You can download the [source on GitHub][5].

Getting started with Unyson is extremely easy, but slightly different than how you&#8217;d typically upload a theme. Installation of Unyson is like so:

  1. [Download][6] the framework archive from the frameworkâ€™s [GitHub repository][7]
  2. Extract it to your parent theme directory. After this you must have **_framework_/** directory in parent theme. Itâ€™s mandatory to have this exact same folder structure otherwise it will not work.
  3. Include the Unyson framework by adding this line in your themeâ€™s **functions.php**:

<center>
  <span class="lang:php decode:true  crayon-inline " >require_once TEMPLATEPATH .&#8217;/framework/bootstrap.php&#8217;;</span>
</center>

After that, you&#8217;ll need to add some more code to the beginning of all the PHP files associated with your theme. I suggest you go over the [Getting Started guide][8] and really pay attention so you get a good understanding of what Unyson can do. The documentation is really awesome, most issues or questions you could have are more than likely covered in the docs.

I haven&#8217;t had much of a chance to play with Unyson, but will get the opportunity to on an upcoming client project, so I&#8217;m really looking forward to that.

Unyson is quite new, so hopefully we will see more features as it matures. It&#8217;s definitely worth checking out.
