[<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.longren.org/images/cakeForFirefox.jpg?w=1100" alt="Cake For Firefox" align="left" data-recalc-dims="1" />][1]Firefox recently [released Firefox 2.0][2]. There [was a little slip-up with that release though][3], it hit some FTP servers earlier than it should have.

Anyway, the Internet Explorer team at Microsoft [sent a cake to the Firefox team][1], congratulating them on their release of Firefox 2.0. Pretty weird huh? One would expect the cake to be full of poison, but that&#8217;s not the case. It&#8217;s simply a &#8220;job well done&#8221; present from the IE dev team to the Firefox guys.

It&#8217;s nice to see archenemies sending such nice gifts, even if it is Microsoft that&#8217;s involved. Can you feel the love?
