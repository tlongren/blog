I&#8217;ve been experiencing some issues with sending trackbacks in WordPress 1.5.1.1-beta as of this afternoon. I did an &#8220;svn update&#8221; to update my local wordpress folder and I was updated to revision 2612 from subversion. There&#8217;s a [bug report here][1] that relates to what I&#8217;m experiencing. It seems the latest revision, 2612 has fixed the problem for some users. Unforunately, the problem started with rev. 2612 for me, which doesn&#8217;t make much sense.

If I don&#8217;t see something new in subversion by tomorrow afternoon to fix it I&#8217;ll probably just revert back to a stable 1.5.1 install.
