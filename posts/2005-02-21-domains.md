Well, there&#8217;s not really much new going on for me. Some interesting things are happening at work, all very good, I&#8217;m excited to see the outcome and will discuss a little bit here when I&#8217;m at liberty to do so.

I&#8217;ve registered a couple domain names, I think I&#8217;ve finally chosen the one I am gonna use. It&#8217;s so sweet domains are so cheap now. The first domain I registered was [diplomaticimmunity.net][1] and the second was [blaze-up.net][2]. I think the second domain should be mostly done propogating by now. Doing a whois on blaze-up.net reveals my registrars nameservers even though upon registration I set my own. I don&#8217;t like their setup too well.

Anyway, that&#8217;s it for now, Ashley and I are gonna go out to eat somewhere in Ames. I&#8217;m starving as I haven&#8217;t really eaten much yet today.
