I&#8217;ve updated my [Unwakeable WordPress theme][1] to version 1.1. I got in touch with [Kirk][2] to see if I could use some CSS [from his Sawchuk scheme for K2][3]. Much to my pleasure, he was happy to let me borrow from Sawchuk, so that&#8217;s what I did.

I took the following CSS classes from Sawchuk and implemented them in Unwakeable: download, code, alert, construction, and other. You can [see Kirks test style post here][4] for a taste of what each of these classes does, or you can just take a look below. I had modify some of the classes a little bit. I sometimes post small one-liner pieces of code that didn&#8217;t display very well without some changes to Kirk&#8217;s CSS. I basically just changed some margins around to make the code icon appear correctly, whether it&#8217;s in a one-line or multi-line piece of code.  
<!--adsense-->

  
Just for kicks, you can see all the different classes I&#8217;ve included in Unwakeable 1.1 below.  
**p class=&#8221;download&#8221;**

<p class="download">
  <a href="http://longren.org/mint/pepper/tillkruess/downloads/download.php?uri=http://longren.org/files/unwakeable-1.1.zip">Download Unwakeable 1.1</a>
</p>

<!--more-->

  
**p class=&#8221;code&#8221; or code tags**

<pre><?php
echo "Just some test code.";
?>
</pre>

**p class=&#8221;alert&#8221;**

<p class="alert">
  This is the Alert style!
</p>

**p class=&#8221;construction&#8221;**

<p class="construction">
  This is the Construction style!
</p>

**p class=&#8221;other&#8221;**

<p class="other">
  This is the Other style!
</p>

There you have it. Those are all the classes I included in Unwakable from Kirk&#8217;s Sawchuk scheme for K2. I think it adds some nice visual elements to this theme, something it was really lacking before. I plan on implementing some new features soon, including the ability to customize colors and fonts. I&#8217;d also like to stop using the fields K2 uses to store it&#8217;s options. That way you can have separate configurations for Unwakeable and K2, that is, if you have both themes installed. 

I&#8217;ve updated [the Unwakeable page][1] also. It now [has a changelog][5] and is more clear as to what version is most recent.
