I decided to make the early upgrade to [WordPress 2.1][1]. I just pulled down the latest version of beta 2 via subversion. Pretty much everything is working great so far. Out of all the plugins I use, only the [Flickr RSS plugin][2] caused problems. It refused to load anything, preventing anything below it to load. So, I promptly disabled it and everything was totally normal. I may dig into it later on tonight.

Also, I&#8217;m pleased to say that [Unwakeable 1.2][3] works nicely with WordPress 2.1 beta 2.

I&#8217;m not gonna go into details on the changes in WordPress 2.1. [Lorelle][4] has already taken the time to put together [a nice list][5] of features we&#8217;ll see in WordPress 2.1. All thanks to [Ryan Boren for blogging up a storm][6] on what will be found in WordPress 2.1.

I&#8217;d like to thank all the WordPress developers for all their hard work. As usual, it&#8217;s very apparent the WordPress developers have put a great amount of work in WordPress 2.1. I&#8217;m really looking forward to the release of 2.1, Beta 2 has been great so far.
