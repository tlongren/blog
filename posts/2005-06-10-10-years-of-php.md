Well, PHP recently celebrated it&#8217;s 10 year anniversary. It&#8217;s been 10 years since Rasmus released the first version. I have been using [PHP][1] for 5 or 6 of those 10 years. It&#8217;s my favorite. It&#8217;s really simple. I wouldn&#8217;t even think of using some other language for web development purposes. The software I used before [WordPress][2] was custom written by me in PHP.

PHP isn&#8217;t &#8220;that new scripting language&#8221; like it was even 5 years ago anymore. It&#8217;s been pretty widely accepted throughout the internet community. WordPress is written in PHP, along with tons of other great apps. Said apps might include [Drupal][3], [phpMyAdmin][4], and [phpWebTrace][5].

I dunno what I&#8217;d do without PHP. It makes my life so much easier. I&#8217;ll often times write simple little scripts at work to gather stats from our database. It&#8217;s also useful for pulling data from our database archives for looking @ sales numbers and the like. It&#8217;s being heavily used in our order verification system. I&#8217;ve written a php app to generate our meal prep sheets also.

I&#8217;m glad to see that PHP is doing so well and is starting to recieve support from some major industry players such as IBM. I have no doubt PHP will continue to flourish and will continue to be a driving force in the evolution of the web. It&#8217;s basically the ultimate &#8220;killer app&#8221;. Thank you Rasmus!
