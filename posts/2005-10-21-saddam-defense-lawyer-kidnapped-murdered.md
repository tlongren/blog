An attorney representing Awad Hamed al-Bandar, a co-defendant in Saddam&#8217;s trial, was kidnapped yesterday and turned up dead today. Probably an effort to put a stop to the trial or something. Could also be some extremists taking justice into their own hands. Could be about anything.

[Stop the ACLU][1] has the [story][2].

> BAGHDAD, Iraq &#8211; A defense lawyer in  
> Saddam Hussein&#8217;s mass murder trial has been found dead, his body dumped near a Baghdad mosque with two gunshots to the head, police and a top lawyers union official said Friday.
> 
> In other violence, four U.S. service members were killed in two attacks Thursday, the U.S. military said. Three Marines died when a bomb hit their patrol in the village of Nasser wa Salam, 25 miles west of Baghdad, and other American troops clashed with gunmen, killing two insurgents and capturing four, the military said.

[Outside The Beltway][3] has a good writeup on the subject.
