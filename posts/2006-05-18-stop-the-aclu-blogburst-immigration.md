Crossposted [from Stop The ACLU][1].  
Our erstwhile and dearly beloved President Bush, having found one of his testicles behind the couch, _FINALLY_ gets around to attempting to begin to consider taking the correct course of action by deploying 6000 National Guard Troops to aid ICE in securing our Southern Border in Name Only (SBNO) and the ACLU races with all haste to try to undermine the deployment by whining incessantly and lying to the American people.

&#8220;Oh-ho&#8221; you say, along with &#8220;Kender? How can you say that the ACLU is _LYING_ to the goodly citizens of the United States?&#8221;

Here&#8217;s how, and as usual, it is attributable to The Queen of the ACLU, The Beauty of the Bill of Rights, the Nancy of the Nine Amendments (ask him, there is no Second Amendment) Anthony Romero:

> &#8220;Turning immigration enforcement policy into another military operation is not the answer. The president&#8217;s proposed deployment of National Guard troops violates the spirit of the Posse Comitatus Act, **which prohibits the military from getting into the business of civilian law enforcement.**

(emphasis mine)  
[source][2]  
Did you catch that?

I made it **real big** so you would catch it, but how many of you actually caught it?

Actually the question should be how many of you even know about it?

> SEC. 15. From and after the passage of this act it shall not be lawful to employ any part of the Army of the United States, as a posse comitatus, or otherwise, for the purpose of executing the laws, **[except in such cases and under such circumstances as such employment of said force may be expressly authorized by the Constitution or by act of Congress;][3]** and no money appropriated by this act shall be used to pay any of the expenses incurred in the employment of any troops in violation of this section And any person willfully violating the provisions of this section shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and on conviction thereof shall be punished by fine not exceeding ten thousand dollars or imprisonment not exceeding two years or by both such fine and imprisonment. 

Let me repeat that.

> **except in such cases and under such circumstances as such employment of said force may be expressly authorized by the Constitution or by act of Congress;**

Got that? Never mind the fact that the since the Posse Comitatus Act is an **AMERICAN LAW** it should logically only apply to **AMERICAN CITIZENS!!!!!** But applying our laws to criminal aliens is a fight that the ACLU has won&#8230;.for the moment.

But we all know that where the ACLU is concerned logic has nothing to do with it.

I propose the radical concept that it is SPECIFICALLY the job of the federal government to secure the border, and if we need National Guard Troops to accomplish that goal then that is what needs to get done. If these millions of criminal aliens were coming across with guns and in uniform would the ACLU demand that Bush not send the military to stop the invasion?

I bet they would.

In WW2 the current ACLU would have been suing the government for placing anti-aircraft guns on the coast (many of those were placed on private property with the owners blessings) and demanding that blackout rules be abolished because forcing one to turn out the lights during a possible air raid would put them in danger of tripping on something in the dark, thereby depriving them of their right to Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness. Of course, the ALCU is more than happy to let someone pursue their personal happiness in the dark, often times even when it involves children, but that is a rant for another day.

The fact of the matter is that the government has failed us by refusing to secure the border, and we have been invaded. The ACLU is doing everything in their power to stop the government from doing _ITS&#8217; JOB_ and in the process making us all a little less safe with each and every day that goes by.
