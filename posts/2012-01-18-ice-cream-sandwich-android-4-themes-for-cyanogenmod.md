My post about [making Cyanogenmod look like Ice Cream Sandwich][1] has been pretty popular. There are a lot of folks out there wanting to make their Cyanogenmod 7 phone look like it&#8217;s running Ice Cream Sandwich, and for good reason. The Ice Cream Sandwich style is very nice to look at.

[Sonny Sekhon][2], the author of [the original Ice Cream Sandwich theme][3] for Cyanogenmod&#8217;s theme chooser, has released a number of other Ice Cream Sandwich based themes, in colors other than blue!  
[ad]  
Sonny has added Ice Cream Sandwich themes in the following colors: [green][4], [red][5], [purple][6], [gingerbread color][7], [orange][8], [dark blue][9], [cyan][10] and [pink][11].

All of those are free and can be installed right from the Android Market. Sonny has a [donate version available][12] as well, if you like his work and would like to support him, buying that theme would probably make him a very happy dude.

If you&#8217;re looking for Ice Cream Sandwich themes for ADW or other launchers, you&#8217;ll definitely want to [have a look at this post][1]. That post contains a lot more than just Ice Cream Sandwich Cyanogenmod themes.

You can have a quick look at each of the new Ice Cream Sandwich theme colors in the gallery below (after the break). If I missed a theme from another developer, leave a comment and I&#8217;ll add it to this post.
