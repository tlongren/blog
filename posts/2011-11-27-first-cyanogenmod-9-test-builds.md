A [thread at the XDA Developers forum][1] has been discussing progress on Cyanogenmod 9 (CM9) for the Motorola Defy. The first post includes [a video of a Motorola Bravo running Cyanogenmod 9][2] with Ice Cream Sandwich (Android 4.0). The Motorola Bravo is running Cyanogenmod 9 for the Defy, but it seems to work. You can see the video here at the end of this post.

In the [most recent post][3] in the thread, [josuearisty][4] provides a link to <http://defy-cm.net/ics-test0/>. There you&#8217;ll find two builds of Cyanogenmod 9 for the Motorola Defy.

_**UPDATE 11/29/2011:** [Epsylon3][5] has updated [his original thread][6], his first post now links to <http://defy-cm.net/ics-test0/> as well. There&#8217;s also a new nightly, 111129._

I&#8217;m not even going to install it, it probably has a lot of the issues the [ROM from Epsylon3 has][7]. It&#8217;s still encouraging to see nightly CM9 builds for the Defy popping up though.  
[ad]  
I was a little worried about Cyanongemod 9 even being released for the Defy, but the Defy is one of the most popular devices for the Cyanogenmod team, according to the [Cyanogenmod stats site][8] anyway.

According to the Cyanogenmod stats site, there&#8217;s nearly 50,000 Defy&#8217;s running Cyanogenmod. The Motorola Defy is the umts_jordan device.

If you&#8217;ve got a Motorola Defy and are really, really anxious to run Ice Cream Sandwich, you now have two options. The [AOSP ROM from Epsylon3][7], or a Cyanogenmod 9 nightly from <http://defy-cm.net/ics-test0/>.

I&#8217;ll be holding off on Ice Cream Sandwich for at least another month, probably more. I need to have a very stable phone, and can&#8217;t afford to run bleeding edge software on it.

If you&#8217;ve tried Ice Cream Sandwich in AOSP or Cyanongemod form, let me know, I&#8217;d love to hear what you think of it. You can see the video of Cyanogenmod 9 on the Defy after the break!
