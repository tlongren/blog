My birthday was yesterday (the 17th). It was pretty good. <A href=http://www.dive2live.com/>Dad and Carol</a> came down to visit. Carol took Kyle&#8217;s graduation pictures. Saturday night, we went out to eat at Buca di Beppo. I&#8217;d never eaten at one before, and it sounded pretty good. I got way more food than I needed&#8230;I&#8217;d say I ate about 1/20th of the food I got.

Lastnight, my grandparents visited me at Mom&#8217;s house. We ate dinner, had pie, and I opened cards from the Grandparents. The whole weekend was pretty good.
