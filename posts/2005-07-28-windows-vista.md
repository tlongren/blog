So, the Windows Vista Beta 1 was released yesterday. It hit [MSDN][1] sometime yesterday morning. It&#8217;s all over BitTorrent networks now too. I&#8217;m gonna give it a shot tonight as I have an extra PC to try it out on. I really don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll like it that well. Probably just more bloatware.

I can&#8217;t really comment on Vista though as I haven&#8217;t tried it yet. Jeremy Wright&#8217;s Ensight has [some good information][2] about Vista though. He&#8217;s got a few [links][3] to [screenshots][4].

TDavid @ Make You Go Hmm [doesn&#8217;t understand what all the excitement is about][5]. And neither do I frankly. I suggest you [read his take][5] on all the microsofties partying it up for the beta release of Vista. Seems silly to me too.

I am mostly interested in what Microsoft has done with the user interface. Does it have a dashboard? I know there was talk a long time ago about a dashboard in Longhorn, dunno if it came through into the Vista Beta 1 or not. I stopped paying attention.

I hope [Gnome][6] officially adds some sort of dashboard soon. I think the Longhorn dashboard was different than the [dashboard in Mac OS X][7]. The dashboard that was in Longhorn and may be in Vista (I dunno yet), is more like [Beagle][8], which looks awesome. Beagle is similar to the [Spotlight in Mac OS X][9]. I&#8217;d actually expect to see Beagle in [Dropline Gnome][10] sooner or later, even if it&#8217;s not part of the official Gnome. The Gnome people seem to be really good about [scheduling releases][11] and sticking to those deadlines. I&#8217;m not sure if they plan what new software to include in future releases. I&#8217;d bet Beable will officially be included with Gnome around Gnome 2.2 or 2.4, if the releases continue being numbered as they are now.

This was supposed to be a post about Windows Vista. Maybe I should have touched on that subject after actually trying Vista. Doesn&#8217;t matter, cuz Gnome kills Windows in terms of UI.

Oh, and for those of you who don&#8217;t want to validate your copy of Windows to get updates, see below. Found this [via BoingBoing][12].

> Before pressing &#8216;Custom&#8217; or &#8216;Express&#8217; buttons paste this text to the address bar and press enter:
> 
> javascript:void(window.g_sDisableWGACheck=&#8217;all&#8217;)
> 
> It turns off the trigger for the key check. 

After doing that, the page where you select &#8220;Custom&#8221; or &#8220;Express&#8221; is reloaded. Select your option and you can get the updates you want (not just the critical updates) without validating. 

<div class="wpulike wpulike-default " >
  <div class="wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked">
    <button type="button"
					aria-label="Like Button"
					data-ulike-id="1955"
					data-ulike-nonce="90610e42bc"
					data-ulike-type="likeThis"
					data-ulike-template="wpulike-default"
					data-ulike-display-likers="0"
					data-ulike-disable-pophover="0"
					class="wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_likethis_1955"></button><span class="count-box"></span>
