Ben Gray [released Unsleepable 2.0][1] earlier today. Version 2.0 of [Unsleepable][2] is based on code from K2 0.9.1. From Openswitch:

> Iâ€™ve just released version 2.0 of unsleepable. It is based on the K2 v.0.9.1 code and I have left all appropriate credits in the CSS. New to version 2.0 is shadows, a taller header, rolling archives, better live search, tweaked comments display and reply form, split footer, and more stuff that youâ€™ll find out as you go.

Pretty sweet Ben, you shoulda done this about a week ago. ðŸ™‚ It&#8217;s just my luck to see a new release of Unsleepable soon after [I released a theme][3] based off the old Unsleepable. Guess it&#8217;s time for me to update the [Unwakeable][4] code already. Look for a new version of Unwakeable by the end of the week.
