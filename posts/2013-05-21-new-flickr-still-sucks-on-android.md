I [wrote a post a couple months ago][1] asking [Flickr][2] why they can&#8217;t add automatic photo upload to their Android app. Today, Yahoo made a lot of updates to Flickr, along with their purchase of Tumblr, but that&#8217;s a whole other story.

The [new Flickr Android app][3] interface is definitely better than it was. But it&#8217;s still missing the one key feature that it needs, and that&#8217;s automatic photo uploading. Dropbox does it, Google+ does it, there&#8217;s even third party apps to do this with Flickr, even though none seem to work any longer.

I managed to kind of sync my phone photos to Flickr. It involves using [Ifttt][4], copying my photos to a specific public Dropbox folder, and telling Ifttt to send all photos in that folder to Flickr. Not the best solution but it&#8217;s all I&#8217;ve got for now.

Yahoo, please, please add automatic photo uploading in the next version of your Android app. I&#8217;m literally begging you. **Flickr is supposed to be the place that ALL my photos end up**, but that can&#8217;t be until you implement automatic photo uploading.

I&#8217;ve been a Pro member for at least 7 years. The least you can do is hook me up with a much needed feature. ðŸ™‚
