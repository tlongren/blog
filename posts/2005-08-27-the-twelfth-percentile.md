Only [12% of americans][1] believe pulling out of Iraq would stop terrorist attacks. Personally, I would have thought the number to be higher than that.

Traderrob over at The Jawa Report [has all the goods][2]. [Wizbang][3] has the same news, but with an update including another poll. The other poll on Wizbang isn&#8217;t exactly surprising, if you know someone in Iraq, you&#8217;re more likely to support the war.

Looks like Cindy Sheehan doesn&#8217;t have the support the media wants us to think she does. These numbers make me happy.
