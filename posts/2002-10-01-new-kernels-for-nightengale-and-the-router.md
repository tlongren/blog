I upgraded kernels on nightengale and vectraxw (the router) to 2.4.20-pre8-ac3 today. The &#8220;make modules_install&#8221; step doesn&#8217;t go to well on nightengale though. It moves the modules around alright, but when it&#8217;s done it spits out hundreds of lines of errors. It still works wonderfully though.

I also tried compiling the 2.5 development kernel, but, as expected, that didn&#8217;t go over so well.
