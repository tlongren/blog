[Version 0.9.1 of the K2 WordPress theme][1] has been released. I just upgraded and finished making all my little customizations. It&#8217;s a recommended upgrade as it fixes a number of bugs. This release comes almost 2 weeks after [K2 0.9 was released][2].

I can&#8217;t wait for the final release of K2. I think we&#8217;ll see a number of [schemes (themes)][3] released once the final K2 is here. I am gonna buy a CSS book this weekend. Anyone got any suggestions?
