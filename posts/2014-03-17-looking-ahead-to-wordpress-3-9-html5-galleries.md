## HTML5 In Your Galleries {.subtitle}

In WordPress 3.9, we&#8217;ll be able to [declare HTML5 support][1] for our galleries! [ThemeShaper has an excellent article][2] detailing HTML5 galleries in the upcoming WordPress 3.9.

According to the [ThemeShaper article][2], this is how it&#8217;ll work:

> Once a theme declared support, the definition list elements will be replaced by <span class="lang:default decode:true  crayon-inline " ><figure></span> and <span class="lang:default decode:true  crayon-inline " ><figcaption></span> for better semantics. If you decide to not only adopt this new feature but also maintain backwards compatibility, then there are two ways to achieve that:

The two options they mention to maintain backwards compatibility are:

  1. Style the new elements and add CSS selectors for the traditional definition list elements. That&#8217;s what ThemeShaper [did for the _s][3] starter theme.
  2. Filter the shortcode attributes and override the tag parameters. Since the shortcode\_atts\_gallery filter was introduced in 3.6, youâ€™ll be backwards compatible with the latest two versions.

For more details on option one, [see how ThemeShaper handled it][3]. If you went with option two, you&#8217;d need to add this to your theme&#8217;s **functions.php** file:

<pre class="lang:php decode:true " >function prefix_gallery_atts( $atts ) {
    $atts['itemtag']    = 'figure';
    $atts['icontag']    = 'div';
    $atts['captiontag'] = 'figcaption';
 
    return $atts;
}
add_filter( 'shortcode_atts_gallery', 'prefix_gallery_atts' );</pre>

This post is primarily targeted towards people who are developing custom themes, available publicly or not. Most of the themes I develop are private and are used for one specific client&#8217;s site.

Not the best fit for inclusion in a functionality plugin. I suppose you could, only if you have no other choices, which you do. 

<div class="wpulike wpulike-default " >
  <div class="wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked">
    <button type="button"
					aria-label="Like Button"
					data-ulike-id="6160"
					data-ulike-nonce="03e1d191bc"
					data-ulike-type="likeThis"
					data-ulike-template="wpulike-default"
					data-ulike-display-likers="0"
					data-ulike-disable-pophover="0"
					class="wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_likethis_6160"></button><span class="count-box"></span>
  </div>
</div>
