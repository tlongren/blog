You may have noticed I&#8217;ve added subscribe widgets at the end of every post, right below the related articles. It&#8217;s really simple to do, and comes built-in with the [Jetpack WordPress Plugin][1].

First, make sure you&#8217;re using a child theme so you&#8217;re not changing the core code of your theme, as your changes will be lost on updates. You can read about creating a child theme [here at the WordPress Codex][2].

### 1. Register New Sidebar

First, add this to your `functions.php` file. It will [register a new sidebar][3] called _Subscribe In Page_.

<pre class="lang:php decode:true " >register_sidebar( array(
    'name' =&gt; 'Subscribe in page',
    'id' =&gt; 'subscribe-in-page',
    'before_widget' =&gt; '&lt;div id="subscribe"&gt;',
    'after_widget' =&gt; '&lt;/div&gt;',
    'before_title' =&gt; '&lt;h3&gt;',
    'after_title' =&gt; '&lt;/h3&gt;'
) );</pre>

### 2. Call Our New Sidebar

Now, in your [WordPress loop][4], find something like <span class="lang:php decode:true  crayon-inline " ><?php the_content(); ?></span>. Here&#8217;s what my `the_contenet()` call looks like:

<pre class="lang:php decode:true " >&lt;div class="entry-content" itemprop="mainContentOfPage"&gt;
    &lt;?php the_content(); ?&gt;
    &lt;?php wp_link_pages( array( 'before' =&gt; '&lt;div class="page-links-next-prev"&gt;', 'after' =&gt; '&lt;/div&gt;', 'nextpagelink' =&gt; '&lt;button class="next-page-nav"&gt;' . __( 'Next page &rarr;', 'independent_publisher' ) . '&lt;/button&gt;', 'previouspagelink' =&gt; '&lt;button class="previous-page-nav"&gt;' . __( '&larr; Previous page', 'independent_publisher' ) . '&lt;/button&gt;', 'next_or_number' =&gt; 'next' ) ); ?&gt;
    &lt;?php wp_link_pages( array( 'before' =&gt; '&lt;div class="page-links"&gt;' . __( 'Pages:', 'independent_publisher' ), 'after' =&gt; '&lt;/div&gt;' ) ); ?&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-- .entry-content --&gt;</pre>

Notice there&#8217;s a couple functions after <span class="lang:php decode:true  crayon-inline " >the_content()</span>, this is normal and will vary from theme to theme. Any plugins you&#8217;ve got set to appear below your post will be shown, and then the subscription form will be shown.

### 4. Add Your Jetpack Subscribe Widget

Just like adding a normal widget. Go to **Appearances**, and then **Widgets**. You should see an area titled **Subscribe In Page**. Drag the _Blog Subscriptions (JetPack)_ widget into the Subscribe In Page sidebar area. Configure it, save it.

### 5. Add The Sidebar To The Theme

To add the Jetpack subscription form, add <span class="lang:php decode:true  crayon-inline " ><?php dynamic_sidebar( &#8216;subscribe-in-page&#8217; ); ?></span>, which calls our custom sidebar, to your loop. It should go somewhere under `the_content()` if you want it to show at the end of the post. If you want it at the beginning, add <span class="lang:php decode:true  crayon-inline " ><?php dynamic_sidebar( &#8216;subscribe-in-page&#8217; ); ?></span> before `the_content()`.

### You&#8217;re Done!

And that&#8217;s really all there is to adding a subscribe form to the end of each post. You can also add the same subscribe form in the sidebar, like I have at longren.org. As a note, the [Jetpack][1] plugin is packed full of functionality. Chances are good that you&#8217;ll find more Jetpack modules to use, other than the [Subscriptions module][5].
