[This][1] is quite disturbing. An 8 year old Iranian boy was caught stealing some bread. What&#8217;s the best way to punish a young boy who must resort to theft to keep food in his belly? Run his arm over with a truck of course.

[These pictures][2] may disturb you. The little boy&#8217;s facial expressions are horrible. How anyone could hold a small child down while he&#8217;s run over with a truck is beyond me. It&#8217;s no wonder there&#8217;s so many murders and terrorists living in that region, look at how the discipline their young. I&#8217;d cut that guys head off were he ever to cross me on the street.

H/T [Jay @ Stop the ACLU][1]. Heidi at [Euphoric Reality][3] hopes &#8220;ALL those Muslim men burn in hell for eternity after soaking for a millenium in pigâ€™s blood.&#8221; I&#8217;m with ya there Heidi.
