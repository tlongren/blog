Back in October 2010, [Jesper][1] released [version 1.2][2] of his [HTML5 design][2].

I remember looking at it and thought it looked pretty nice. I downloaded it and it sat on my desktop for a long time.

There was a Blogger template based on his HTML5 design, but nothing for WordPress, so that&#8217;s where this theme comes in. HTML5Press is nothing more than Jesper&#8217;s HTML5 design with WordPress functionality added in.

I&#8217;ve got the theme setup on a test site, which you can [find here][3]. I took the liberty of fixing the CSS menus. In version 1.2 of Jesper&#8217;s work, there&#8217;s some issues with styling sub-menus. I doubt the average user would notice them, but I did, and they had to be fixed.

That&#8217;s really the only style related modification I made to Jesper&#8217;s HTML5 design.

### Some WordPress features HTML5Press supports:

  * Featured Images for Posts
  * WordPress Navigation Menus
  * WordPress Widgets
  * Threaded Comments

HTML5Press is available under the [GNU GPLV2 license][4]. The code is [hosted on Github][5]. The official homepage for the theme is located [right here on longren.org][6].

A download is not yet available but will be in the next few days. If you really want to, you can download from the [HTML5Press Github repo][5], but it may not work as I&#8217;m making changes at a pretty quick pace. Your best bet is to hang off a day or two for an official release.

If you do decide to download an early copy from Github and notice issues, please use the [issue tracker at Github][7] to report problems. As usual, let me know if you have any comments, questions, or suggestions. You can comment on this post or you can comment on [the HTML5Press page][6].
