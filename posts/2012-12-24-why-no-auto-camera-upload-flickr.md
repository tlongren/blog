I&#8217;ve been a pro [Flickr][1] member for many years (since 2004 actually). Every photo I&#8217;ve taken since probably 2002 or so is on Flickr. Flickr released a [decent Android app][2] a while back, but it&#8217;s lacking one major feature, auto uploading photos.

Dropbox does it, Google+ does it, even the Facebook app does it. Yet Flickr, a fucking photo website, does not have this feature in their Android app. Not only that, but there&#8217;s not even a bulk upload option. Only way to upload an image to Flickr through the official Flickr app is to upload photos one by one. And uploading one by one isn&#8217;t gonna happen when I snap 20+ photos every day on my LGE Nexus 4.

There&#8217;s a fair number of apps in the Google Play Store that do automatic photo uploads, but it&#8217;s really painful for me to use a separate app for something that should be included in the official Flickr app. I just can&#8217;t fathom why they would not add this feature. I understand this feature not being there right off the bat, but [it&#8217;s been over a year][3] since the official Flickr app for Android was released.

I&#8217;ve used a couple of the third-party Flickr apps that have auto upload functionality. Many of them are clunky and none (that I&#8217;ve seen) adhere to the [Android style guidelines][4]. I did just install [Flicker (sic) Uploader Free][5], as I have never used it before. However, I have a little bit of an issue with an app that doesn&#8217;t even get the name of the service it supports correct. Maybe spelling Flickr as &#8220;Flicker&#8221; was intentional, I dunno.

Bottom line is there&#8217;s no great solution for automatically uploading photos taken on your Android device to Flickr. Here&#8217;s to hoping Flickr steps up and adds this functionality at some point, even if it doesn&#8217;t come until a year from now.
