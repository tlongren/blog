Wow! [Apache][1] 2.0.54 has finally been released. 2.0.53 was released a long time ago, probably around January. I haven&#8217;t seen this size of a gap between releases in a while. I was starting to get worried.

Anyway, it&#8217;s here, and I&#8217;m compiling it on this server right now. You can read the release announcement here: <http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/Announcement2.html>.
