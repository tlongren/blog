I think it&#8217;s snow. We&#8217;re having the first decent ammount of snowfall in Iowa this year. Supposedly we&#8217;re gonna get about 16&#8243; over the next 36 hours.

Ashley&#8217;s car sucks ass in the snow. I barely got it out of the parking lot this morning. The snow plows piled a bunch of snow up behind her car. The rear wheels on her car would get out fine, but when it was the front wheels turn, they wouldn&#8217;t go. After about 5 minutes of toying I finally got it out.

It&#8217;s supposed to keep snowing throughout the day and tonight. Suprisingly almost everyone showed up to work. Even people I was sure wouldn&#8217;t show up are here.
