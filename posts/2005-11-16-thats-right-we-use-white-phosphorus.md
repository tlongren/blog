The BBC came out with a [Q&A about white phosphorus][1] today:

> The Pentagon&#8217;s confirmation that it used white phosphorus as a weapon during last year&#8217;s offensive in the Iraqi city of Falluja has sparked criticism.

Why criticism? Oh yah, because we&#8217;re the U. S. of A. Sure, some civilians probably were affected by the white phosphorus, but there&#8217;s always some collateral damage. There&#8217;s no doubt white phosphorus is dangerous and should only be used in the most severe of circumstances. I think Fallujah last year is a key example of one of those circumstances warranting the use of white phosphorus.

> **What are the international conventions?**

> White phosphorus is covered by Protocol III of the 1980 Convention on Conventional Weapons, which prohibits its use as an incendiary weapon against civilian populations or in air attacks against enemy forces in civilian areas.

> The US &#8211; unlike 80 other countries including the UK &#8211; is not a signatory to Protocol III.

See that there? Yah, there&#8217;s nothing prohibiting the U.S. from using white phosphorus against any group, even civilians. So, if we did intentionally use white phosphorus against civilian groups, what action would be taken? Probably none. I highly doubt the U.S. used white phosphorus on civilians intentionally. If there were civilians affected, it&#8217;s because they were sticking around in Fallujah with the insurgents. And if that is the case, the civilians deserved everything the insurgents got. Why would a civilian stick around other than to assist the insurgents or to protect their homes? My point is, white phosphorus wouldn&#8217;t be used agains civilians unless they were presenting some sort of threat, which they most likely were.

And, besides that, white phosphorus isn&#8217;t even a chemical weapon. [John Cole][2] seems to feel pretty strongly about that. It&#8217;s almost always used to provide a smoke screen. It will produce a very dense cloud of smoke that can provide cover for troops. Like everything, white phosphorus can be used for evil.

My 2 cents.
