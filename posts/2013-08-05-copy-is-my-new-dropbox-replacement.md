I&#8217;ve written about [other Dropbox alternatives][1] before. I still use Dropbox daily, but am always interested in the alternatives, especially free alternatives that provide more free storage space.

[Copy][2] is one of those alternatives, and I think it may eventually replace Dropbox entirely for me.

They start off by giving you 15GB of free storage. If you sign up from someone&#8217;s referral link, [like mine][2] (<https://next-d.copy.com?r=1XNUBL>), you&#8217;ll get an additional 5GB. So you&#8217;ll start of with 20GB of storage, free. Get friends to sign up using your link and you&#8217;ll get 5GB for each referral.

But, if you don&#8217;t sign up from someone&#8217;s referral link, you&#8217;ll only have 15GB to start, instead of 20GB. You&#8217;ve also got to install the client somewhere (on your pc or phone) before you get the additional 5GB after signing up.

[Their pricing][3] is incredibly, absolutely **_sane_**, too. $9.99 a month will get you 250GB of storage, or $99 every year for the same 250GB.

I really like Copy because of it&#8217;s linux client and because of [it&#8217;s Android client][4]. Both are very nice and easy to use. I especially like the Android client because it will auto-upload photos and videos you take, just like Dropbox for Android does.

The [Copy iOS client][5] doesn&#8217;t do auto-uploads like the Android client does. I guess that&#8217;s what they get for using iOS devices. I have included a screenshot of Copy on an iPad mini on iOS 6.1.3. You can see it in the gallery at the end of the post.

The linux client is nice but I&#8217;d like to see it cleaned up a little. It consumes nearly as much memory on my Xubuntu 13.04 box as Dropbox does. _CopyAgent_ uses 57.7 MB of RAM and _dropbox_ uses 60.2 MB.

So, if you like this kinda stuff, [sign up for Copy using my referral link][2].
