## Prettier YouTube Embeds

[PrettyEmbed.js][1] is a jQuery plugin for making your YouTube embeds look much better. It&#8217;s [on GitHub][1], and a [demo can be seen here on CodePen][2].

PrettyEmbed.js works with [FitVid.js][3], but it&#8217;s not required, and comes with options like high-res preview images and advanced customization of embed options.

You can see some of the advanced customization options in the CodePen demo below. Just click the &#8220;JS&#8221; tab to see the JavaScript.

See the Pen [PrettyEmbed.js Demo][4] by Mike Zarandona ([@mike-zarandona][5]) on [CodePen][6].

I&#8217;ve used this for a number of client websites, people like to host their videos on YouTube, yet have an elegant looking player that&#8217;s not screaming YOUTUBE when it&#8217;s embedded. This is where PrettyEmbed.js comes in. This is for those of you who want nice looking YouTube embeds.

Documentation is quite good and provides a list of all options and how to use it with HTML5 or with Javascript. It does require jQuery.
