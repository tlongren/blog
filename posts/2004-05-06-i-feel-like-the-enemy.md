Recently, I have been doing a lot of thinking about the state of the world and our (American) societey. When I think of all the ways our government is trying to provide us with a sense of security, I almost start to feel MORE un-safe.

You see, the thing is, I worry that many freedoms will be taken away from U.S. citizens&#8230;by our own government.

I think it will eventually get to a point when citizens of the U.S. will realize that their freedom is more important than security.

What will happen once people realize freedom is more important than security? Who knows. I wouldn&#8217;t dismiss the possibility of an attempted goverment overthrow by the general public as their freedoms continue to be taken away.

When the time comes that random searches of peoples houses are taking place, you can be sure I will be leaving, for a safer place. I find it totally ironic that the government trying to provide security for us, results in me and probably many other people feeling very un-safe&#8230;sometimes even scared.

I fear some of the things I&#8217;ve discussed are due to massive corruption on the side of the U.S. government. Actually, I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s corruption, or just being out of touch with the people. The people elected to represent the views of the people don&#8217;t do so anymore&#8230;something has to change, soon.
