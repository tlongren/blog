</p>

**Thumbnail Viewer** is my first WordPress plugin to be released to the public. I used the [WordPress Lightbox 2 plugin][1] as a starting point and implemented CSS and Javascript from the [Image Thumbnail Viewer from Dynamic Drive][2]. There&#8217;s [another WordPress plugin][3] based on the same code from Dynamic Drive, but it doesn&#8217;t have a quicktag to automatically add the code to your posts/pages. The &#8220;loading&#8221; image and text also seems to be broken in that other plugin.

The **Thumbnail Viewer plugin** is simply used to overlay images on a page, similar to [Lightbox JS][4]. Click on the images below to see the **Thumbnail Viewer plugin** in action.

<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.longren.org/images/corn.jpg" rel="thumbnail" title="Some Corn"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.longren.org/images/cornThumbnail.jpg?resize=129%2C96" width="129" height="96" alt="Some Corn" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.longren.org/images/crackerJacks.jpg" rel="thumbnail" title="Some Cracker Jacks!"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.longren.org/images/crackerJacksThumbnail.jpg?resize=98%2C123" width="98" height="123" alt="Some Cracker Jacks" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.longren.org/images/peas.jpg" rel="thumbnail" title="Some Peas In A Pod"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.longren.org/images/peasThumbnail.jpg?resize=145%2C96" width="145" height="96" alt="Some Peas" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>

Here&#8217;s a description of the Image Thumbnail Viewer from Dynamic Drive, the code this plugin is based on:

> Image Thumbnail Viewer is a compact, unobtrusive image viewer that can be applied to any link on the page to load the desired image inside a sleek interface based on the link&#8217;s &#8220;href&#8221; value. Simply give the link in question- be it a text link or image thumbnail link- a rel attribute of &#8220;thumbnail&#8221;, and you&#8217;re done.
> 
> This script will center the enlarged image on the page and optionally display a text description based on the activating link&#8217;s &#8220;title&#8221; attribute. A fading effect can be turned on/off to bring the final image into view.

<p class="download">
  <a href="http://www.longren.org/wordpress/thumbnail-viewer/">1.0 is old, go get the newest.</a>
</p>

### Installation

  1. Extract _**wp-thumbnailviewer**_ folder from .zip to _wp-contents/plugins/_.
  2. Go to Plugins in WordPress dashboard and activate _**Thumbnail Viewer**_.
  3. That&#8217;s it! Write a new post to use the quicktag button or simply add rel=thumbnail to any link tag.

<p class="information">
  Functionality in IE7 is broken (sometimes) in 1.0. The div to display the full image works in some IE7 installs but doesn&#8217;t work in others. Will be fixed for 1.1.
</p>
