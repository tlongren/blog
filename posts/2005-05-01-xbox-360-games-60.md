Word is games for Xbox 360 could reach the $60 mark. That&#8217;s shitty but I kinda expected that. Still, that&#8217;s a lot for a game.

Via [Take Back The News][1]:

> Games can cost anywhere from five to thirty million dollars to develop these days. While the [prices are going up][2] few games will maintain that high prices for long. Most will likely drop in price quite rapidly after the initial post-launch sales flood.
