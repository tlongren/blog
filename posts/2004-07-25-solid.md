Now that I&#8217;ve had the chance to listen to the entire Trance Empire 10 mix by DJ Pi, I can safely say that DJ Pi is the most solid trance dj I&#8217;ve ever listened to.

I mean, the guy hasn&#8217;t released a mix that I haven&#8217;t thouroughly enjoyed. I can&#8217;t say that about any other dj. I hope that I can someday listen to Pi&#8217;s stuff on [di.fm][1]. He needs to submit a mix to di.fm, i guarantee they&#8217;d add him to one of their streams.
