[The Jawa Report][1] has news of Arthur Chrenkoff retiring from his blogging career. Chrenkoff ran the super popular pro-war &#8220;[Chrenkoff][2]&#8221; blog.

Chrenkoff made his [last post this morning][3]. One of Arthurs most popular items was his &#8220;Good News from Iraq&#8221; postings. In light of Chrenkoff leaving the blogosphere, a new blog has popped up that will take over covering good news from Iraq. The blog, [Good News from the Front][4], will be filling the void. Looks like they&#8217;re already doing a nice job.

Chrenkoff the man will be greatly missed within the blogosphere but his reasoning for doing so is solid. He&#8217;s moving his professional career forward, not something you can really do in the blogosphere. He&#8217;s done so much in terms of bringing to light all the good our troops have done in Iraq and in the war on terror in general.

Others covering: [Outside The Beltway][5], [Decision &#8217;08][6], [The Coalition of the Swilling][7], [California Conservative][8], and [Mudville Gazette][9].
