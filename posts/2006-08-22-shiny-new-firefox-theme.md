So, I just [installed][1] the [&#8220;nightly&#8221; Mozilla Firefox 2.0 Beta 2 RC1][2]. It&#8217;s a whole lot more stable than Firefox 2.0 Beta 1 was.  
[<img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/static.flickr.com/83/222033444_d8f28d68a1.jpg?resize=500%2C364" width="500" height="364" alt="tlongren" data-recalc-dims="1" />][3]  
I really like this new default theme. It&#8217;s much prettier, although I don&#8217;t really like some of the icon choices.

In addition to the new theme, there&#8217;s also some apparently new functionality when downloading .exe files. Every time I download a .exe it pops up a window saying &#8220;You have chosen to open blahblah.exe&#8221;. Only, it won&#8217;t let you open it directly, you gotta save it to your hard drive somewhere first.

I think I am going to stick with this release until FireFox 2.0 Beta 2 officially comes out, because as I said before, this is just a nightly build with the Beta 2 name RC1 name. This release has yet to crash on me, where Firefox 2.0 Beta 1 crashed roughly 10 times each day. Looks like the Mozilla team has been busy.
