&#8230;maybe. Nobody seems to be sure. Lots of coverage on this as it&#8217;s pretty big/good news. It seems al-Zarqawi is dead. Or perhaps he&#8217;s severely wounded. Or maybe he&#8217;s out playing raquetball wit his homies right now. Whatever the case, something&#8217;s up.

His cronies are supposedly fighting over who&#8217;s gonna take over command. Some of them claim he&#8217;s not been wounded at all and is still leading without problems. I think the guys over at [Scared Monkeys][1] have the [best summary so far][2].

Rusty, from [The Jawa Report][3] also has [good coverage of the story][4].

I&#8217;m not going to bother posting what they already have. In my opinion, he&#8217;s dead. Why else would they keep insisting he&#8217;s still leading and is just fine? They just dun wanna let on yet that he&#8217;s gone. Some sort of propoganda I suppose, dunno how it&#8217;s supposed to effect the good guys.

Go [read it at Scared Monkeys][2] or [read at The Jawa Report][4]. Whichever you choose, you&#8217;ll get a nice rounded feel for the situation.
