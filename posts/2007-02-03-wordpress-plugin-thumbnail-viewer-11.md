</p>

I&#8217;ve released version 1.1 of my **Thumbnail Viewer plugin**, which still needs an official homepage. This release was prompted by a problem with showing the quicktag when authoring a new post or page. The quicktag wasn&#8217;t showing on WordPress 2.1 installations. So, as a result, WordPress 2.0.x is no longer supported by the **Thumbnail Viewer plugin**. If you want to use this plugin you&#8217;ll need WordPress 2.1 or later. Really, the plugin should still work with WordPress 2.0.x, however the quicktag won&#8217;t be available when writing a new post.  
<!--adsense-->

  
The issues in Internet Explorer 7 [I spoke about earlier][1] haven&#8217;t been resolved, quite. I&#8217;d say the plugin works fine in 98% or more of all Internet Explorer 7 installations. I&#8217;ve only had problems on one installation of IE7. I&#8217;m pretty sure this problem isn&#8217;t even directly related to this plugin. I say that because [the demo page for the code][2] this plugin is based on won&#8217;t work either in that same IE7 install. So, it&#8217;s apparently a problem in the javascript this plugin is based on. I guess as of right now, I&#8217;m considering the div display problem in IE7 to be out of my control.

Anyway, click the images below for a demo.  
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.longren.org/images/corn.jpg" rel="thumbnail" title="Some Corn"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.longren.org/images/cornThumbnail.jpg?resize=129%2C96" width="129" height="96" alt="Some Corn" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.longren.org/images/crackerJacks.jpg" rel="thumbnail" title="Some Cracker Jacks!"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.longren.org/images/crackerJacksThumbnail.jpg?resize=98%2C123" width="98" height="123" alt="Some Cracker Jacks" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.longren.org/images/peas.jpg" rel="thumbnail" title="Some Peas In A Pod"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.longren.org/images/peasThumbnail.jpg?resize=145%2C96" width="145" height="96" alt="Some Peas" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>

The above example was achieved with the following HTML:

<pre><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.longren.org/images/corn.jpg" rel="thumbnail" title="Some Corn"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.longren.org/images/cornThumbnail.jpg?resize=129%2C96" width="129" height="96" alt="Some Corn" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>
<a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.longren.org/images/crackerJacks.jpg" rel="thumbnail" title="Some Cracker Jacks!"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.longren.org/images/crackerJacksThumbnail.jpg?resize=98%2C123" width="98" height="123" alt="Some Cracker Jacks" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>
<a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.longren.org/images/peas.jpg" rel="thumbnail" title="Some Peas In A Pod"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.longren.org/images/peasThumbnail.jpg?resize=145%2C96" width="145" height="96" alt="Some Peas" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></pre>

</p>

### Installation

  1. Extract _**wp-thumbnailviewer**_ folder from .zip to _wp-contents/plugins/_.
  2. Go to Plugins in WordPress dashboard and activate _**Thumbnail Viewer**_.
  3. That&#8217;s it! Write a new post to use the quicktag button or simply add rel=thumbnail to any link tag.

### Upgrading

  1. Simply overwrite everything in _wp-contents/plugins/wp-thumbnailviewer/_ with everything in the _**wp-thumbnailviewer**_ folder from the zip file.
  2. That&#8217;s it! You should now be using the latest Thumbnail Viewer WordPress plugin.
