I think this blog gets way more spam than your average blog. For instance, over the lifetime of this blog (a little over 4 years), it averages about 95 unique visitors per day. Pretty poor average, I know, but this blog existed for 2+ years being read only by my family. Over the last year and a half or so, my averages have been up around 150 &#8211; 200 uniques per day.

Now, comment spam wasn&#8217;t a huge deal here until about a year ago or so. When it became a real problem, I installed [Spam Karma][1], which has stopped pretty much all of it. How many pieces of comment spam does &#8220;all of it&#8221; equal? Right about 60,000 comment spams, in nearly one year. See the little black bar at the bottom of this page? It counts the number of comment spams that Spam Karma has stopped. It currently reads **&#8220;This blog is protected by Spam Karma 2: 62528 Spams eaten and counting&#8230;&#8221;**.

It&#8217;ll be at 62700 or so by tomorrow morning probably. Maybe I&#8217;m way off, but I just think this is an awful lot of comment spam compared to the relatively low amount of &#8220;real&#8221; traffic this site sees. But whatever, I&#8217;m just glad to have Spam Karma.
