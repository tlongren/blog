I upgraded the kernel on nightengale to 2.4.20-pre6. I&#8217;ve fallen behind in kernels. VectraXW (the web server) is still running 2.4.18 (the latest stable is 2.4.19). I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll be able to get 2.4.19 to work on VectraXW though because it failed horribly while booting on another machine (the router), which is the same type of machine as VectraXW.

2.4.19 even broke some stuff on nightengale. It broke my mouse if one of the usb modules were compiled as a module (as opposed to being compiled into the kernel).
