Kos says that the islamic nut jobs are a lot like people on the right. The left shouldn&#8217;t be allowed to play anymore. They can&#8217;t play nice, all they can do is defame and condemn. First it was Kos, then Ted Rall saying Karl Rove is worse than bin Laden. Now we&#8217;re back to Kos being stupid again. Kos supposedly wrote it in response to [IowaHawks][1] [amusing little post about patriotism][2].

[The Museum of Left Wing Lunacy][3] has the [bulk of what Kos wrote][4]. You can read it at their site, they&#8217;ve also got a link to the original Kos post.

Rusty from the Jawa Report was able to do basically the same thing as Kos, only his is way more accurate and insightful&#8230;see below.

> **Religious Practice**  
> Al Qaida/Taliban: We tolerate you as long as you practice in private  
> Kos Leftist Taliban: We tolerate you as long as you practice in private  
> The Right: Religion can be practiced anywhere, including public spaces
> 
> **Religious Freedom**  
> Al Qaida/Taliban: Forbidden in Koran  
> Kos Leftist Taliban: Forbidden in Constitution  
> The Right: Inherent part of Christianity
> 
> **Church State Relations**  
> Al Qaida/Taliban: The religion of the State is Islam  
> Kos Leftist Taliban: The religion of the State is Atheism  
> The Right: no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof
> 
> **Equal Rights**  
> Al Qaida/Taliban: Different punishments depending on sex  
> Kos Leftist Taliban: Different punishments depending on race  
> The Right: Equality before the law

Now, I&#8217;m not saying that Karl Rove isn&#8217;t one evil dude, because I believe he is. One man shouldn&#8217;t carry that much influence in our government. And he looks like a little piggy. I really enjoyed American Dad&#8217;s take on Karl Rove on one of their more recent episodes. I love American Dad, it&#8217;s one of my all time favorite shows. Along with the Simpsons, Family Guy, Futurama, and King of the Hill.

I&#8217;m done now, got a little off topic.
