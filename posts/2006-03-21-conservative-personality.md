I don&#8217;t really think I&#8217;ve got a conservative personality, my ideas are more conservative though. I&#8217;ve actually got an extremely liberal personality, I think. Although, I am whiny sometimes, and I wouldn&#8217;t say &#8220;I&#8217;m not crazy.&#8221; According to [a recent study][1], I probably do have a conservative personality. Here&#8217;s a bit from the new [Red America][2] blog:

> Apparently, this violent testosterone-fueled psychological imperitive &#8211; not a coherent and just strategy for defending America in response to the first major attack on our soil since Pearl Harbor &#8211; is the real reason for our war in Iraq. Oh, and Condi Rice? Don&#8217;t worry, women can have manly envy, too. Clearly, Maggie Thatcher did.

I guess I wasn&#8217;t aware there were many effective warfare strageties that don&#8217;t involve violence. I think I&#8217;m gonna enjoy reading [Red America][3], a lot. Hopefully it&#8217;ll stay around for a while, I like Ben&#8217;s sense of humor, and his cool last name &#8220;Domenech.&#8221;

And while we&#8217;re at it, [MacStansbury][4] is loving our &#8220;new media&#8221;. He&#8217;s got a post that&#8217;s &#8220;Not a &#8216;sop to the paperâ€™s right-wing critics&#8217;.&#8221; The &#8220;paper&#8221; being [WaPo][5], of course.
