It&#8217;s been a very long time since I&#8217;ve changed the look of this website. I previously used my [Unwakeable theme][1] for WordPress, but wanted to switch to something else.

I came across the [Mystique theme][2] the other day and thought it had a nice look to it, so that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m using now. Just a base Mystique install, nothing changed but a bit of custom CSS added.

I&#8217;ll probably stick with Mystique for a while before switching to something else again. I do know that I&#8217;m not going to keep this theme as long as I did Unwakeable. I&#8217;m going to try switching up themes every six months or so.

Also been thinking about moving this site to Drupal for a while. I&#8217;ve never really used Drupal much, never on a live site anyway. We&#8217;re starting to use Drupal at work and I&#8217;ve liked it pretty well so far, although I still like the WordPress dashboard better.

What do you think of this new theme?

**Update 1/21/2011:**  
I did end up having to modify [an image][3] that comes with Mystique. The image was [box.png][3] and it overlays the categories, tags, archives, etc on the right sidebar. I have an extensive archive (going back to March 2002). The image was only 2000 pixels high, so I had to make it a bit taller. So that&#8217;s really the only change I&#8217;ve made, bringing that image from 2000 pixels high to 3000 pixels high.
