Be very careful of the most recent unstable version of [WordPress][1]. I downloaded the latest and greatest WordPress via [Subversion][2] this morning. Subversion is the tool the WP developers have been using for version control. It&#8217;s similar to CVS.

After upgrading, my WordPress version jumped to 1.6-ALPHA-do-not-use, which kinda scared me. The admin area didn&#8217;t really work at all, it didn&#8217;t even recognize me. I think it would have allowed anybody to login as my username wasn&#8217;t shown as usual, but I could still see all the admin pages.

It also broke all my plugins. I did notice some cosmetic changes to the admin area. Mainly a new font. Dunno if that&#8217;s temporary or a permanent thing from now on. Soon after seeing the version number, I downloaded 1.5.1.2 and reverted back to that without problems.

I hope a somewhat stable version appears in subversion again soon as I really like using the bleeding edge versions, mostly just to test em out. I&#8217;m not going to take my chances running software that has &#8220;ALPHA-do-not-use&#8221; in it&#8217;s version name. Now, I&#8217;m fully aware of the risks I run when using these unstable releases, so don&#8217;t bother telling me.
