Saw this interesting little article about benefits of using the Favicon on your website this morning at [Search Engine Roundtable][1]. I use one on this website, it should look like<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.longren.org/images/favicon.png?w=1100" alt="My Favicon" data-recalc-dims="1" /> .

> Having a favicon for your domain name will not currently help your search engine rankings. But it does have indirect benefits that might, in the long run, benefit your site&#8217;s rankings. This is the topic of a threat at SEW Forums named Is there any SE benefit to using a favicon.ico file?.
> 
> (1) Makes your site standout from the others (since many still do not have favicons).  
> (2) The extra branding might help you get more links to your Web site, helping with search engine ranking.  
> (3) On some browsers, that have &#8220;tabbed browsing&#8221; (Firefox, Ssafari, Netscape), it helps identify which tab has which site in it.  
> (4)Keeps your error logs cleaner

I started using one just to clean up my log files a little bit. After seeing about a million 404 errors due to a non-existant favicon.ico I got tired of it and just added one. 

<div class="wpulike wpulike-default " >
  <div class="wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked">
    <button type="button"
					aria-label="Like Button"
					data-ulike-id="1863"
					data-ulike-nonce="518118f6a6"
					data-ulike-type="likeThis"
					data-ulike-template="wpulike-default"
					data-ulike-display-likers="0"
					data-ulike-disable-pophover="0"
					class="wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_likethis_1863"></button><span class="count-box"></span>
  </div>
