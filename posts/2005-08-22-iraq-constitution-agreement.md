It&#8217;s [being reported][1] an agreement about Iraq&#8217;s constitution has been accepted by the parties involved.

> National Assembly member Bahaa Al-Aaraji just told Al-Iraqia TV that an agreement has finally been reached among the leaders of political bodies on the final draft of the constitution and that disputes over issues like federalism, distribution of resources and the role of Islam have been solved.

As usual, I have The Jawa Report to thank for [the information][2]. No mention yet of what the actual agreement is.

Will give updates as they become available. This news comes via [Iraq The Model][3], a blog run by two Iraqi brothers who were born in and still live and work in Iraq. They have some great insights, as you could probably imagine.

**UPDATE:** Iraq The Model [has an update][1] in which they discuss the role of Islam in the Iraqi government.

> It was agreed upon that no laws that are against the widely agreed upon values of Islam can be issued and no laws that are against the values of democracy and human rights can be issued.  
> Natural resources according to the draft will be managed in cooperation between the central government and the local administrations of the federal states/provinces.

[Captain Ed&#8217;s][4] got some related items and thoughts too. He goes a little deeper into how the Sunnis are gonna get screwed. [Iraq The Model][5] touched on that a bit. According to Captain Ed we&#8217;re pretty much at the same place we were when the extended deadline was issued. Sad and probably true.

**UPDATE 2:** [More updates][1] from Iraq The Model and also at [Captain&#8217;s Quarters][4]. The most important part:

> Voting will be postponed for another 3 days until the leaders of political blocks can reach accord on the few remaining disputed issues.

Gotta try to get the Sunnis on the ship. Like 3 days will make any difference&#8230;

And Jay at Pro Ecclesia is [getting &#8220;off the bus&#8221;][6] in his support for the Iraq war. I&#8217;m afraid there&#8217;s probably a lot of people that feel how he does. I have the same feeling, but I&#8217;m not giving up on the war as the war isn&#8217;t just about Iraq.

[Chrenkoff][7] has [a great post titled][8] &#8220;When democracy becomes infections&#8221;. He points out that many Sunni insurgent groups are calling on their supporters to register to vote. It&#8217;s a really good read. Also, Aaron at [Lifelike Pundits][9] highlights some of the [draft constitution][10] sections that caught his attention. One piece he makes note of is &#8220;Iraqis are free to abide in their personal lives according to their religion, sects, beliefs or choice&#8221;. I hope the draft is full of that stuff. I&#8217;m going to read through it tonight.
