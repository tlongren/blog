After spending about 1.5 hours on hold with Mediacom lastnight, I finally got an answer as to when someone would be out to my place again. The tech is supposed to be to my apartment between 8:00 am and 5:00 pm on Friday April 29th.

They got some idiot call center people working at Mediacom. They always ask if I&#8217;ve power cycled my modem. I reply &#8220;yes&#8221;, and then proceed to tell them my internet hasn&#8217;t worked for 2 weeks. And then they ask if I&#8217;m running windows, to which I reply &#8220;no&#8221;. Then they panic and tell me they can&#8217;t support my setup. I wish they&#8217;d let me worry about what software I run and just worry about getting a good signal to my apartment.

My cable TV doesn&#8217;t even look the greatest anymore. All the lower channels look like crapola. They&#8217;re really grainy and have this weird hum to them sometimes. I know it&#8217;s not Mediacom&#8217;s responsibility to keep the city of Nevadas cable infrastructure up to date, but rolling out new services on that cable when it can barely handle the current workload just doesn&#8217;t make sense.

I highly doubt Kim, the guy that owns the apartment building, will want to pay Mediacom to upgrade the cable setup in the apartment. I dought even more highly that Mediacom would be willing to foot the bill. When the tech is out on Friday I&#8217;m gonna see if he can replace just enough cable to get me a good signal and I&#8217;ll just fucking pay for it. I&#8217;m takin that cable with me when I move out though&#8230;
