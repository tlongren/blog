## A flat & sexy Sublime Text theme. Pushups not included. {.subtitle}

[Brogrammer][1] is a new Sublime Text theme from [Ken Wheeler][2]. It&#8217;s awfully nice to look at, and use. I&#8217;ve been using it for the last couple of days and have enjoyed it, and it&#8217;s included Brogrammer color scheme.

[Brogrammer is on GitHub][1] and can also be installed via [Package Control][3]. After you&#8217;ve installed it, either from GitHub or with Package Control, activate it by replacing the `theme` and `color_scheme` parameters in your user preferences file with the following:

<pre class="lang:default decode:true " >{
  "theme": "Brogrammer.sublime-theme",
  "color_scheme": "Packages/Theme - Brogrammer/brogrammer.tmTheme"
}</pre>

I tend to keep a pretty close eye on GitHub and Package Control for new Sublime Text themes. I&#8217;ll post more as they pop up. Always nice to change things up. 

<div class="wpulike wpulike-default " >
  <div class="wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked">
    <button type="button"
					aria-label="Like Button"
					data-ulike-id="6063"
					data-ulike-nonce="d87364b6f2"
					data-ulike-type="likeThis"
					data-ulike-template="wpulike-default"
					data-ulike-display-likers="0"
					data-ulike-disable-pophover="0"
					class="wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_likethis_6063"></button><span class="count-box"></span>
