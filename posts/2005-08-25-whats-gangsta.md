Beating the hell out of war veterans of course. No, in all seriousness, these three thugs beat the crap out of some war veterans the other day in Seattle. Luckily the whole thing was [caught on video][1]. They need help finding the suspects though. The suspects are black.

Racism is apparently very prolific in the blogosphere. If you [read the comments][2] on Ace of Spades HQ, you&#8217;ll probably see some extremely racist comments. Ace has been deleting them for the most part.

Some rather unwholesome comments have also been showing up at [The Jawa Report][3]. Chris over at [Conservative Thinking][4] touched on basically all of this too, focusing more on the racism issue. And don&#8217;t forget [Captain&#8217;s Quarters][5]. 

I think I know why all these people are saying very demeaning things about blacks and just being dirty biggots in general. They&#8217;re jealous. The guys in the video clearly got game and are &#8220;gangsta&#8221;. This and the fact that they beat some war veterans angers many people that aren&#8217;t comfortable with who they are. I&#8217;m not defending the suspects, but come on people&#8230;grow up.

Maybe people are just so angry because they beat up the war vets. But why don&#8217;t they say this stuff when the islamocrazies bombed london? Doesn&#8217;t make a lot of sense to me, that&#8217;s why I suspect they&#8217;re jealous. The three suspects, when found, should be put in prison that just happens to house some older war vets. I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;d be put out of their misery within 48 hours.

[Blogs for Bush][6] has a somewhat related story about anti-war protests going on outside the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C. What&#8217;s worse, is the protestors hold signs that read &#8220;Maimed for Lies&#8221; while injured soldiers are recovering and dying inside.

Now that&#8217;s seriously fucked up. Yah, they have a right to protest. As far as I&#8217;m concerned, they shouldn&#8217;t be allowed to protest there, of all places. Turns out Wizbang [has an update][7] on this story. [Conservative Outpost][8] has the goods too.
