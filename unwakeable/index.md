Current Stable Version: [1.5.6][1] (Released 2/11/2011)  
[Download Unwakeable 1.5.6][1]{.button.supersize.download}

The Unwakeable [WordPress][2] theme and is a combination of [K2][3] and [Unsleepable][4]. Basically, I used K2 as a starting point, and replaced the default K2 header with a modified header from Unsleepable. After getting a few requests from people wanting this theme, I&#8217;ve decided to release it to the public.

You can see Unwakeable in action at [the demo site][5].

**Please note**, this is not a &#8220;style&#8221; for K2. This is a totally independent theme. However, it should still be able to make use of existing K2 styles that are compatible with K2. Unwakeable is [widget ready][6] and supports all the plugins [already supported by K2][7], in addition to [some others][8].

If you have any requests, comments, problems, or complaints, please let me know. I&#8217;ll be glad to make requested modifications if I find them to be useful. If you&#8217;re wondering about the name, I chose it because it can be nearly impossible to make me wake up at times. And it&#8217;s the opposite of &#8220;Unsleepable&#8221;, I guess&#8230;

For instructions on creating your own title image, see [Ben Gray&#8217;s tutorial][9]. Once you&#8217;ve created the image, save it as **_title.gif_** and upload **_title.gif_** to **_wp-content/themes/unwakeable/images/_**. A good resource for help with customizing Unwakeable is the [K2 wiki][10], most information there applies to Unwakeable as well. Once your site is ready with your chosen theme and your looking for the [best wordpress hosting][11] service, it&#8217;s always best to do some research and read reviews available on the internet.

This version fixes <a href="http://www.longren.org/2007/09/03/unwakeable-xss-vulnerability/">the XSS vulnerability</a> found in the search facility of Unwakeable 1.2. It&#8217;s recommended that all users upgrade to 1.2.1 or <a href="http://www.longren.org/2007/09/03/unwakeable-xss-vulnerability/">patch your 1.2 installations</a>.
</p>

<p class="changelog">
  <strong>2007-01-07:</strong> Unwakeable 1.2 Released. Fixed header CSS so the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tlongren/348651761/">black area is flush</a> with the gray area to the right. Added another visual style for these changelogs. Added support for <a href="http://dev.lipidity.com/feature/wp-plugin-gregarious">Gregarious</a> and <a href="http://theundersigned.net/2006/06/landing-sites-11">Landing Sites</a> plugins. Gave this theme it&#8217;s own options in the wp_options table, this way you can have separate configurations if you have both K2 and Unwakeable installed. Also included is an upgrade script for converting your K2 options right over to the new Unwakeable fields. We&#8217;re now showing post ratings, post views, and Digg on pages. Previously these were only shown on actual posts.
