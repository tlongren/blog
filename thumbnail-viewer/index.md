Thumbnail Viewer plugin for WordPress is simply used to overlay images on a page, similar to Lightbox JS. The javascript is from the Image Thumbnail Viewer code from DynamicDrive. The javascript included in Thumbnail Viewer from [DynamicDrive][1] is much faster than Lightbox JS, although not as feature packed, which is the entire point.

Thumbnail Viewer works with the following image formats: **png, gif, jpeg, jpg, bmp**.

Current Version: [1.2][2]  
[Download Thumbnail Viewer 1.2][2]{.button.big.download}

### Installation

  1. Extract thumbnail-viewer folder from downloaded file to wp-contents/plugins/.
  2. Go to Plugins section in WordPress dashboard and activate Thumbnail Viewer.
  3. Thatâ€™s it!
  4. Now all you need to do is add rel=thumbnail to any link tag surrounding your thumbnail. You&#8217;ll do this when you&#8217;re editing a post or page, you can also use the quicktag button for auto-insertion goodness. 

If you come across anything broken or have any issues, please report problems at [Github][3].

Please [take a look at the FAQ][4] before posting questions, your question is probably answered there. There&#8217;s [also some screenshots][5] for those interested, or you can just see the thing in action right here, just click one of the thumbnails below:  
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.longren.org/images/corn.jpg" rel="thumbnail" title="Some Corn"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.longren.org/images/cornThumbnail.jpg?resize=129%2C96" width="129" height="96" alt="Some Corn" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.longren.org/images/crackerJacks.jpg" rel="thumbnail" title="Some Cracker Jacks!"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.longren.org/images/crackerJacksThumbnail.jpg?resize=98%2C123" width="98" height="123" alt="Some Cracker Jacks" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.longren.org/images/peas.jpg" rel="thumbnail" title="Some Peas In A Pod"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.longren.org/images/peasThumbnail.jpg?resize=145%2C96" width="145" height="96" alt="Some Peas" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>

The effect you see above was created by this plugin by putting the following HTML in this page:

<pre><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.longren.org/images/corn.jpg" rel="thumbnail" title="Some Corn"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.longren.org/images/cornThumbnail.jpg?resize=129%2C96" width="129" height="96" alt="Some Corn" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>
<a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.longren.org/images/crackerJacks.jpg" rel="thumbnail" title="Some Cracker Jacks!"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.longren.org/images/crackerJacksThumbnail.jpg?resize=98%2C123" width="98" height="123" alt="Some Cracker Jacks" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>
<a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.longren.org/images/peas.jpg" rel="thumbnail" title="Some Peas In A Pod"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.longren.org/images/peasThumbnail.jpg?resize=145%2C96" width="145" height="96" alt="Some Peas" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></pre>
