[ColorRating2][1] is a A PHP/jQuery based 5-star Ajax rating script. ColorRating2 was forked from [Jack Moore&#8217;s ColorRating][2]. The only difference is I added support for multiple tables in the SQLite database.

Why do this, you ask? The main reason was to add the ability to do &#8220;Highest Rated&#8221; type things. It also allows you to apply ratings to many different elements of a website (images, videos, comments, or anything really).

For a demo, check out any of the [band pages on Ames Out Loud][3].

You can always download the latest [ColorRating2 at Github][1]. 

<div class="wpulike wpulike-default " >
  <div class="wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked">
    <button type="button"
					aria-label="Like Button"

					data-ulike-nonce="2b41514d85"
					data-ulike-type="likeThis"
